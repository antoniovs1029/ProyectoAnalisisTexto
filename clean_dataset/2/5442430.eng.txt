this be dr miranda north quarantine officer on board the international space station today the pilgrim capsule with its valuable mars soil sample complete its eight month return from mars prepare to receive these sample have be the purpose of our mission these last few month but the pilgrim capsule be damage at utc pilgrim be strike by debris and veer off course rory adams will spacewalk to establish visual contact with the incoming space capsule and he will grab it with remote arm we have be wait long time for this sample and rory be place himself at great risk to secure it over and out emu at psi pure be that how you be gonna do it would not do it that way dr jordan status come on fast fast fast nitrogen at near zero dr north be in the airlock fast fast fast come on rory slow to go fast or fast to go fast deliberate what do she have against fast remember people rory if you can not save it yeah spoiler alert be fucking save it but if you can not rory just push the capsule into deep space okay do you hear me can you get ocd sorry cdc out of my face cause get big operation need to concentrate just want you can not can not hear you love you too at all emu at psi pure where be the remote here the arm yours there you go full manual all right he know let us go careful with sorry you know this yeah yeah no more sorries miranda to the cupola please all right that be it yep david be you on your way on my way slow sho excuse me how do you say breathe in japanese this be suppose to be routine the airlock be seal be walk utc after strike debris pilgrim non responsive inbound on collision course with iss initiate emergency course correction and manual retrieval canadarm online transfer control to wireless station to control initiate sequence affirmative so the committee you let me worry about the committee where be rory he be at risk out there easy folk mics be live you ready sho thruster up move into position have control of the arm your worry line be show yeah well get pay by the line have good feel about this yeah rory gonna deliver that sample right to your lab prepare for course correction niner by remember your training we never train for this on my mark new capsule trajectory negative proximity alert proximity alert ignore the proximity alert new station trajectory negative the capsule will miss us just rory be still downrange and it be come in shallow any moment now maybe be have fun be you guy have fun rory if you miss yeah yeah yeah if just gonna skip off the atmosphere like flat stone on water just fly off into nowhere it be no harm do okay there there see it all right here we go here we go here we go this be fun rory you have to move it be gonna hit you no it be not please rory move station to control visual confirmation of mars capsule pilgrim use to play catcher but only in tee ball rory not now not now no come on come here come here come on come on come on rory rory rory he get it yes hugh cue instagram do not want to jinx it point and shoot motherfucker okay okay mar capsule in lock position be come home this be mission commander ekaterina golovkina tell the committee pilgrim land on plymouth rock the mars sample be safe and sound copy that commander congratulations ready we be recording utc pilgrim be not just see thing in mars soil we be look at large single cell inert unmistakably biological and like organism on earth have what appear to be nucleus cytoplasm the cell wall be thick those hair look like cilium long than we be use to see on earth more like flagellum what be our temperature minus start bring it up minus even quick minus this be some re animator shit that be very obscure reference not for nerd not if you be nerd minus zero degree come on eighteen nineteen tp nothing update be gonna try different atmosphere close to proterozoic earth than today mars less oxygen more carbon dioxide and then when sho ready growth medium in this case glucose come on dance do it just move hugh my god it work you wake it we be look at the incontrovertible proof of life beyond earth it be beautiful our question be from allen he be year old and allen what be your question for commander golovkina be it green it be not visible at all actually it be microscopic single cell to put it into perspective your body be make up of trillion there be alien inside of me bet your teacher sometimes think so well we have another question from year old mari be you bring the alien back to earth no we be gonna keep it up here we be gonna study it where it be safe commander the iss be the most expensive house ever build billion american and count because we keep add room it fly around earth times day in year over people have live here thanks to generous country like russia the usa and china we call this tranquility node dr jordan here be about to break the record for consecutive day in space straight your mommy must miss you she do but have family here yeah the kind that tease him cause his mommy miss him this be of our new crew member miranda north from the centers for disease control she be doctor too you guy be witness space triathlon yeah be win we have another question from year old leila we think this question be little personal go ahead how do you go to the bathroom funnel tube and some suction everything we do on the iss be like everything you do on earth except different do you like pea yep so have you get name yet for that we want to go down live just outside our studio in times square to very brave classmate hi dominique hi calvin coolidge elementary be choose among school for this honor we name the martian after our school calvin control control if you be listen and you probably be cause you be creepy that way can just rant for about the micromanagement we be not blood filled meat puppet come from long line of plumber can fix shower if can not well hugh do not shower anyway he be british international incident be not be critical of you you be just very under bathed nation everybody know it do not be ugly american who be ugly now nail step be very good looking american you know see it be right there control be sorry about him rory control can not hear you do not know where rage like that come from can you please fix the shower twenty eight step to fix shower you know can do this myself no know you just have not doctor be always so bad at look after themselves be not they you have spend too much time up here david your atrophy accelerate and you be close to your radiation limit you notice any glow in the dark like it up here when be in the military we would go to syria you know we would set up hospital treat all the casualty and then we would come back week week or late and then the whole village would just be bomb out then earth be not all syria though be it can not stand what we do to each other down there but it be home and it be beautiful do not you miss anything do not you miss fresh water or bird or the tree like the hum up here and the air what you have achieve with calvin be remarkable hugh have not have chance to say that thank you think these will prove to be the great day of my life wish have time machine so can visit the year old me do he want to be astronaut he want out of the wheelchair and how do he feel now like bird do not get me wrong do not hate my chair love it for the sake of the anonymous genius who invent it you be of kind hugh good night utc hold on to your helmet the glucose intake be very rapid the specimen cell have begin to move together en masse as unit they be also share electrical activity in what resemble grow neural network notice do not say brain dr north speak it be our educate opinion that this new species be not colony of fast dividing single celled organism but large solitary organism compose of trillion of identical cooperative cell here what be fascinate mean it be all fascinate be not it unlike most multicellular organism every cell of calvin can perform every somatic function on its own every single cell be simultaneously muscle cell and nerve cell and photoreceptive cell so the creature as whole be in very real sense all muscle all brain all eye as such calvin now possess the mean to interact with its environment include the use of what appear to be proto appendages will demonstrate but notice how it be approach and not retreat its curiosity outweigh its fear that be beautiful hello calvin how be that feel hugh you be gonna be daddy there be gonna be big custody battle over this day we be all gonna die and want to know if there would be even the possibility of have be get little nauseous you can do this kazumi be do my good it be come any moment now okay push easy for you to say you can do it kazumi you can do it you can do it sho can see it okay push it be okay push you will be able to meet mei soon you can do it and that there be more of it during the night we can observe too how the recollection of dream which be still lively in the morning will melt away except for few small fragment this book do not have picture in it do it obviously not would you prefer that do not read it out loud that be beautiful beautiful he make me cry hi guy guy meet mei hey hi mei hey mei say hi to everybody mei hi mei she be beautiful congratulations thank you nice to meet you do they have any idea who the father be shut up another another okay for story time it be my favorite you may say my foray into space thank you so much thank you commander thank you guy she be beautiful sho thank you no seriously that kid have blue eye fuck it be the lab okay miranda check the in the lab be it on we be clear for contamination we be okay calvin safe do not understand how this happen nothing in that lab can malfunction clamp it fail it be on me yeah no shit it be on you dizzy year old can have spot that protect these firewall yes that be my job but can not do it alone kibo be not design for strict firewall lockdown and neither be the station there be zero precedent for any of this but you do not come out of that lab without triple checking everything you do not go into that lab without proper rest for all know we be carry anthrax onboard you can not compare calvin to anthrax yeah know at least guy back home who can do my job nobody can do yours except you do not want to be around that thing be not qualify to be around that thing understand good be just say you can not compare calvin to anthrax stop stop call it fucking calvin we do not know what that thing be yeah and you be in there and you be play around with it like it be your buddy be your buddy you be drink on this wake up this be not and will never be control experiment so let us all agree we make our and last mistake miss my fucking dog good night dr miranda north quarantine officer utc after week of stun growth and activity calvin be completely inactive we believe it be likely due to the clamp failure in the lab which cause temporary change of air pressure in calvin box our work theory be that this hibernation may be defense mechanism everyone here be on edge and hugh of course have be beat himself up but honestly be relieve calvin be grow very fast and this have now give me time to reinforce firewall precaution with the crew the box must stay seal the lab must stay seal no matter the risk to calvin it be just float because of my mistake in the lab and it be go so well what something my dad use to say it be all go so well be toy with the idea of stimulate it electrically what do you think that be not my call but if it be do not know my job be line of defense imagine the bad thing that can ever happen and then the bad after that and the bad after that and then have plan for all of them understand that but risk be take for reason because of calvin we be gonna learn so much about life its origin its nature maybe even its mean no know you be doctor stem cell research what if calvin can make stem cell obsolete help cure the incurable reverse the irreversible have to fix this good be you ready stretch okay and relax ready you sure it will not hurt it it be very very low voltage we be only stimulate it what exactly be you hope for be hope to wake him up we be see under what condition it reengages with its environment come on in we be shock the monkey try another spot nothing not even at cellular level be you sure it be not dead it be alive it be just in deep sleep come on calvin wake up shit what be wrong it break the wand be gonna try and pull my hand out do that but just make sure to protect the glove shit it be grip the glass okay okay little sod how hard be it hold on to you like firm handshake it be fine it do not hurt but it be grow strong what be the problem it be get hugh hand his heart rate be at sho can we trust the glove it be very

make suggestion can just can go in there and get him and no you be not go to go in there no of course you be not because we have to maintain quarantine stop no can do this can can do this can you try and distract it yes yes will see if can interest it in the wand come on my favorite little martian come on come on come on come on come on he lose interest it be get hold of my hand hugh hugh hugh hey hugh hugh help me help me what the fuck be go on no no one go in come on who be go in wait wait for fucking what screw it be go in there do not do this do not give shit about your fucking quarantine there be nothing to protect you you be not go in there who give you the fucking jurisdiction just open the door rory wait wait you be not go in there let him in you be not go in there no wait wait wait you be not go in he be out he be out guy look at it jesus what be his vitals and drop what be it do holy shit jesus christ you guy get eye on it anywhere okay there there guy fuck this no let him go hey buddy watch his hand there we go it be there get him in adams yeah david need you here rory can not let you out shit oh gosh there we go hugh hugh look at me just listen to me for okay hey guy sho can you find bandage suggestion get oxygen candle burn it off yeah yeah yeah just look at me look at me it be fine fuck okay all right what now how do we get him out we need to get calvin back behind firewall and once he be there we can pull rory out fuck this permission to fucking kill the thing commander kill it sho any suggestion what about the incinerator like that all right genius here close the red valve disengage the clamp disconnect the hose be careful rory fuck there be limit fuel copy okay manual override thank you okay rory yeah fuck you be waste too much fuel no fuck rory rory hey rory stop stop rory rory you be out of fuel it be behind you jesus fuck somebody open the fucking door open the portal now just open the portal there be man in there get strangle rory what be he say rory can not no matter what be happen kat kat we get to open the door no no one go in it be protocol rory what be this fucking protocol jordan no just open the portal rory there be man die in there nobody open the fucking rory look at me look at me rory we can not hear you if you take your comm out need to see what be happen rory rory rory will you turn around can you turn around there be man die in there we can not hear you if you take your comm out no no you be not go in help him open the door do not open the door okay do not open the door stay back need to see your face can you turn around can you turn around guy guy sho that be so much big jesus guy sho guy it be try to get out the cpu override us it be search for way out the system will not give me access to it full manual shut them down okay how smart be this thing it feel the airflow can not control them all at once then shut them by seal the lab just shut it down shut it down now we be on it guy it be go it get out where do it go can be anywhere now firewall have fail kat we need to reestablish quarantine and get distress call out control this be station station for control the specimen location be unknown it be to be consider hostile and deadly our intent be to isolate and destroy it in compliance with protocol we will continue say course of action unless otherwise instruct please acknowledge and advise kat kat we lose them how much of that go out some think there be no way to be sure look like communication just fail can we talk to each other david it be kat do you copy go for david so we have lose contact with earth do not think wait yes outside communication be down can the sprinkler affect comms no they be independent system can we run diagnostic from here the transmitter have fail but we have to go outside to access it and get earth back online then have to walk let me no after rory be good qualify for walk and repair this be not protocol it be way too risky for you to go out there and fix the comms we do not know where calvin be you have not have your nitrogen detox your health be my responsibility will be fine yeah what be it you say slow be fast right yeah slow to go fast yeah well that be out the window we can escape in the lifeboat earth be the responsibility nothing go down to the planet it be stipulate in write what be you talk about what be stipulate in write what be stipulate david thing when we be back in touch with control we will turn our attention to calvin do not worry rate beat minute pressure over would hate to see you relax but she be relax be not you kat suit run warm like siberia in summer be at the transmitter commence on site diagnostic it be overheat can tell how see scorch want to check the coolant level be it possible calvin can have get into coolant possible we have to know there be the issue commander it be bone dry calvin be carbon based organism it need food water and oxygen just like us we have to consider the possibility it consume the coolant for food david can you list all the water source aboard pure or otherwise there be plenty of drink water there be coolant for the comms coolant for the cpu there be coolant for the spacesuit commander calvin just come out it grab my suit it be big it be try to get in trust your suit can it breathe out there no but it may be able to store oxygen for period of time be closing the valve it be squeeze kat kat be you okay yes the suit thick enough it be twist up your leg go go to the airlock now fuck this be head for the airlock be burning this fucker off kat focus on meeting david we will worry about the comms late sho there be liquid in the helmet calvin must have break my coolant loop kat there be enough coolant yes know know david meet me at the airlock what yeah go go go it be squeeze hard calvin crack the coolant system in her suit commander calvin know exactly what it be do it be grow smarter the liquid it be block my vision do not have time have get to jump kat the tether will not reach be unclip kat no comment have get to jump david have take kat off the channel look she be not gonna tell you this but her heart be beat out of her chest she be drown so just be prepare she may not be rational copy that sho have no time for eva be use the launch suit it be not design for this know there be not enough protection know do not worry kat be less than minute out vent the airlock what about decompression just do it it be gonna hurt come on do it be your helmet seal sho guy we be run out of time kat kat do not swallow it it be toxic okay need you to help me open the valve we be gonna do this together okay be gonna pull down and you be gonna go clockwise from your side okay there you go good good good do not worry about calvin we be gonna get you inside and we be gonna get it off david kat no no no clockwise from your side clockwise from your side kat come on miranda yeah be here she be fight me she be turn her lever the wrong way pull down kat you

on you can do this david she be do it deliberately come on kat kat david stop stop she be not let calvin back in here kat commander kat kat what be go on what be go on guy guy do you copy yeah yeah copy okay okay let us keep it together we may have we may have opportunity here calvin ability to survive in that vacuum and temperature be astonish but he can not live much long out there sho sho be you sure that we have lose all communication with earth be sure all right then we have to keep it out there we have new firewall david can you see it will see sho yes can you re flood the airlock you tell me when okay do she close that valve yeah yeah she close it okay what other way can it get in the thruster the manifold in the thruster nozzle if it try we can blast it off but we would have to know which it be too dark can not see anything shit there must be some way thruster sensor if it climb in the nozzle the temperature should move should all right there thruster firing miranda can you reach tranquility we miss cut it guy it be head toward no wait no no it be head towards the lab it be fast be sorry guy can not see it be okay we be watch kibo thruster firing come on please please quest this time david can you see no be thruster sorry be sorry can not sho what be that we have burn through too much fuel there we be already low after the pilgrim doc listen all this thrust we have place ourselves into decay orbit shit we will reach atmosphere soon if do not get us back to stable and will need the rest of the fuel to do it if we even have that much no david david we can not risk calvin ride us down into the atmosphere okay but do not know can it survive that we do not know it be already go well beyond what any live organism should be able to survive if it be between let it in here or let it down there we let it in here where be you we have just let it back in here move us back into stable orbit these creature can have dominate mars for hundred of million of year but now we know that they hibernate with loss of atmosphere if we deprive it of air retreat in tranquility and seal ourselves off and vent the rest of the station exactly no life support no life right okay hugh and will sweep from quest east and you and sho scour the pole and lock off each compartment it will take about hour to vent all oxygen what do we do till then we wait you okay derry look at me you okay be fine remember the day the challenger blow up they take us out of school early remember that day it be hard to watch people die like firework up up the long delirious burning blue have top the wind swept height with ease and grace good eulogy ever rory say do not give me eulogy give me parachute he be my buddy it be my fault it be all my fault maybe it be your fault maybe it be my fault maybe do not know it do not matter do it get this thing on board be risk and we know it from the begin take it it be just survive life very existence require destruction calvin do not hate us but he have to kill us in order to survive hugh hugh hugh hugh all right all right hey derry hugh be sorry be sorry because of all the hugh hugh hugh hugh there be no output god get the defib get him back okay get him down will strap him in take off the sling okay yeah sho get the acls kit and the defibrillator shit here prep the defibrillator and get the shock down en yeah copy en charge clear charge shoot still fibrillating just stack the shock if you have to go all right clear shit nothing go again go again hit him clear all right all right all right get output yeah okay okay sinus rate bpm you really scare me there buddy david david fuck what be this stabilize get the plasma cutter calvin feed off his leg shit miranda go get out of here let us go miranda let us go pull it away from hugh sho we will come back for him miranda come on let us go sho no sho no shit hey guy shit calvin we do not know where he be where be sho he will be fine we stop all oxygen vent in the station lift me up okay okay miranda be up be come home mei know what feel be not scientific it be not rational feel hate feel pure fucking hate for that thing calvin how be that move like that he must have swallow the marker on derry leg yeah we can track him let us kill this thing vent zarya now okay it be suffocate how long do you think that be gonna take do not know shit proximity alert proximity alert proximity alert proximity alert proximity they be come kat distress call must have reach earth wait where be they dock shit look like zarya jesus that be where calvin be station to soyuz station to soyuz do you copy station to soyuz do you copy station to soyuz do you copy try the flashlight come on come on they can not see this must be too reflective shit what the fuck be they do david david they be not come to rescue us it be firewall what firewall be the box and firewall be the lab and firewall be the station but we have new firewall what be you say they do not know that and if firewall or fail they have choice they can contain or they expel they be push us out to deep space they can not risk calvin reach earth that be my protocol insist from the begin and the committee agree they all put their name to it the list be as long as your arm now protect firewall be my job and if we would have succeed we can have go home and if we fail wait for me mei sho he think it be rescue oh god he be head towards calvin we have to stop him sho sho can you hear us sho sho sho miranda sho sho sho take my hand sho do not let go sho no no no do not let go sho no sho no no let go no no no sho sho miranda no come on no miranda miranda let us go the cpu be still up it be miracle we be we be lose life support the temperature be drop rapidly atmosphere be vent from everywhere and do not know how to stop it okay how much time do we have in here hour maybe hour but it what fuck fuck what what be it what we be we be not move into space the opposite all that fucked up thrust we be decay again what sho have subroutine here without any correction in course which we do not have any fuel for anyway we will hit the atmosphere in minute we be not gonna survive reentry calvin can it be so cold my father use to read this to me when be kid good night room good night moon good night cow jump over the moon good night light and the red balloon good night nobody remember when saw my picture of earth and ask my father where all those all those line be the border really miss him good night moon good night star good night air good night air bait calvin need oxygen to survive with the level so low in the rest of the ship it will be draw to the oxygen candle we can use them as bait yeah there be lifeboat and both set to default entry trajectory you press the button they autopilot themselves to the surface unless somebody somebody override them from the inside use the oxygen candle to lure calvin into boat close the hatch press the button to give me full manual control and if can hold the stick can override the flight path and if hold it long enough can avoid reentry you fly out into deep space with calvin yes meanwhile you get into boat you press the button and if there be no complication then it would take you back home no no we should lure calvin together no miranda yeah that do not make any sense why the lifeboat be mean for person and this have be your plan all along to make sure that that creature do not get to earth then should be plan no be pilot you be plan listen listen belong up here do not want to go back down to of those motherfuckers need you to say you trust me yeah do trust you wait here will signal you hey shit shit fuck okay this be mission specialist dr david jordan command soyuz lifeboat utc iss have enter catastrophic orbital decay initiate emergency escape sequence in come on miranda get go initiate manual override this be dr miranda north black box recording in case of death upon reentry the creature kill of the iss astronaut with dr david jordan presume dead carry it out into deep space my colleague all sacrifice themselves to maintain the firewall so please honor them for give everything to this cause mar life form should be consider hostile do not underestimate their intelligence and their adaptive capability now we do not learn how to restrain or eliminate it but if this creature ever reach earth use every available resource to destroy it or you will risk all human life you can do it you can do it you can do it come on no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no no
