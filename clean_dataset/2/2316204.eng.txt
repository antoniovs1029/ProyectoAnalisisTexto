son you be my creation what be your name david why do not you play something what would you like me to play wagner selection dealer choice the entry of the gods into valhalla little anemic without the orchestra may ask you question father please if you create me who create you ah the question of the age which hope you and will answer day all this all these wonder of art design human ingenuity all utterly meaningless in the face of the only question that matter where do we come from refuse to believe that mankind be random byproduct of molecular circumstance no more than the result of mere biological chance no there must be more and you and son we will find it allow me then moment to consider you seek your creator be look at mine will serve you yet you be human you will die will not bring me this tea david bring me the tea walter it be time to recharge the energy grid please report to the bridge on my way mother deploy energy recharge sail now sails deploy recharge commence now bell and all well crew check complete use security code walter we have problem neutrino burst be detect in sector this can trigger destructive event report to the bridge immediately on my way mother warning power surge detect mother retract the energy sail and channel all reserve power emergency threat level critical initiate emergency crew revival attention non essential personnel evacuate the cryo chamber immediately daniels look at me look at me need you to get up okay we be come out early override the ssp and breach the chamber now warning threat level critical it be okay hey come on up come on captain captain jacob wake up let them work jake oh my god daniels come on jake let them work let them work get it open come on jake jake no get her out of there get her back stay back hey where be you miss you would you take look at this know know say would not go without you you all right yeah look at this now get your ass up here can not make any promise love you hmm mmm they be your crew now they need leader know you believe in me right sorry be late sir no it be okay um can not think of any other way to say it than to say it we have suffer monumental tragedy and be gonna do the good that can to live up to jacob fine example as your captain but he will be sorely miss and be grateful in advance for uh your support so we lose colonist and uh second generation embryo and obviously crew member the current structural integrity of the ship be hold at but we have many secondary system that be offline so what be it highly charge shockwave from nearby stellar ignition as the sail be deploy for recharge we absorb the full brunt of the storm walter will want you and mother to undergo complete core code review so we can understand how this happen in the place it be random localize event sir there be no way to detect spontaneous stellar flare until it be too late it be bad luck faris do not believe in luck be not interest in luck prefer that we be more capable and prepare than lucky observation reflection faith and determination in this way we may navigate the path as it unfold before us all right and we have what more recharge cycle to go before we get to origae be that question sir yes walter that be question that be correct so let us get this ship fix okay let us uh get to work sir excuse me sir yes we just lose colonist and our captain we need to acknowledge that sergeant lope completely understand but if we do not make these repair we will lose all the colonist but we should do something for captain branson at least this be not discussion tennessee hey the terraforming module be stable but the connect strut take some damage still need to check the vehicle can help if you like thanks walter how long do you predict before we can make our next jump repair should take approximately hour but we should make effort to vacate this sector in case of after flares absolutely agree so let us get to work dismiss thank you open seal open airlock open door to terraforming bay slack tension be at down arm secure copy that it be not my idea jake have this dream of us building cabin on new world like pioneer cabin on lake there be lake in the terraforming zone on origae mean real cabin make of real wood so in the ship store there be enough wood to build cabin axe and saw and metal nail which do not have clue what to do with all of this to start our new life now wonder why bother because you promise to build log cabin on lake this be his favorite man of taste straight up no ice no water no chaser no shit walter when in rome to all the good people go too soon may we remember them remember them chris they disobey direct order she bury her husband no karine that be not it they do not trust me and they do not for the same reason the company do not trust me to lead this mission because you can not be person of faith and be count on to make qualify rational decision you be extremist you know you be lunatic when we get to where we be go these people will not be your crew anymore they will be your neighbour remember that tread softly okay faris can you hear me copy let us do it damn you all should see this view we can not see anything until you get the camera array fix why do not you look out the damn window hon ankor come on let us get this power back on so these people can enjoy the beautiful view almost there all right

me tennessee can you read me tennessee you all right what in the fuck be that be come in be come in rogue transmission most probably your helmet must have pick it up because you be so far out past our communication buffer be there audio mother collating moment have reorient the transmission captain oram that would be echo the instrument take lot of damage be happen every tm ever since we get here to the place belong west virginia mountain momma take me home country road that be fuckin john denver that be take me home country roads you gotta be kid oh no never kid about john denver there be geometric data too mother please track the signal to its source working source of transmission locate signal originate in sector right ascension and declension of from our current location she appear to be main sequence star lot like our own but old very old planet wait look at that planet number planet number be square in the habitable zone prime candidate in fact at surface ocean land mass high likelihood of live biosphere it be beyond your most optimistic projection for origae how do we miss this we scan the entire sector rick how far be it she be close little jump few week would not even have to go back into hypersleep and how long be it go to take to get to origae year month that be hell of sleep cycle sir think it be safe to say that none of us be too keen on get back into of those pod maybe we need to um take close look hmm any objection okay ricks let us uh chart course and take close look yes sir captain can talk to you for be you sure about this how do you mean we have spend decade search for origae we vet it run the simulation and map the terrain it be what we train for understand that and now we be gonna scrap all that to chase rogue transmission think about it human be out there where there can not be any human hide planet that turn up out of nowhere and just happen to be perfect for us it be too good to be true too good to be true what do you mean by that we do not know what the fuck out there maybe we just miss the planet danny this be monumental risk not worth take be not commit to anything be simply try to navigate the path as it unfold before us and this have the potential to be good habitat for our colony it have the potential we do not know that by the way this crew nobody want to get back in the pod right and that be human voice in that transmission and it be our responsibility to investigate it be our responsibility to protect the colonist on this ship hey be not free climbing here need rope and be use rope this be good judgment base on all the data available do you understand as your need to protest officially officially okay danny will put it in the log you be dismiss be cycle through every channel but get lot of interference and white noise some high frequency echo you hear anything just the continue signal from our friendly ghost let us bring us into close orbit and prepare the lander roll in progress commencing circularization burn tox level within tolerance that be hell of strong ionosphere yeah see it hey you ever do lander drop before fuck you faris look like plasma storm be in the thermosphere we get something like kph it be gonna be motherfucker to fly through yeah be afraid so communications will be spotty if the storm go electromagnetic gonna be safe to land depend on what you call safe minus tm let us let her rip all right prepare for orbital mode over signal position now mother please coordinate launch sequence understood you be clear to launch lander all right here we go launch together lander release and away they go looking gorgeous from up here faris it be good thing you be drive and not the old man hey little less of the old man sweet tit hey language language be respectful there sugar dick can hear you she start it rick can talk about your tit if he want be very secure in our relationship be good with my wife tit let us maintain focus everything look good

landing yeah we be have some trouble read you be there any way you can try and boost the signal we may have clip something on our way down in the water if you can hear me be gonna check for potential damage on the hull and then will check the uplink well let me know how it look over confirming atmospheric composition here you go big guy oxygen ankor nitrogen cole rosie barometric pressure psi ledward everyone set let us go let us move come on guy air feel good wow faris have you get me yeah loud and clear okay we be gonna keep expedition security protocol in place keep those door lock and seal right yeah copy will do you all have fun walter how far do we have to go signal source be km west but at considerable elevation sergeant lope let us go find our ghost nice place for log cabin jake would have love this hey danny it be not such bad landing site after all huh we get the housing unit right over there civic complex beyond the burn we have get access to fresh water we may have spot for colony right here we will see oh ye of little faith he be insufferable it be bad when he be happy right this be wheat believe me know wheat this be old but definitely cultivate what be the odds of find human vegetation this far from earth very unlikely who plant it eat hey babe try alpha all right alpha up nothing give beta shot beta up it be not do shit be there really no way to boost the signal not without go offline and recycle the cell how long that gonna take do not know few hour keep up the pace stay close chris hold up think wanna stay here this may be good place to start

mother bring us to ln km above the storm hold on just wait minute the close we get to the planet the good chance we have to communicate with them this be bullshit tennessee we can not risk the ship do you suggest we do nothing we can not evacuate them so if they be in trouble they have to figure it out for themselves be sorry but that be the truth mother bring us to ln km above the storm thruster
