how many child or no the bird do not attack until the child be outside the school help you mrs bundy need some change mr carter crow think well do not know daddy be there difference between crow and blackbird there be very definitely difference miss thank you they be different daddy well think these be crow well yes hundred of them yes they attack the child attack them well do not know when but simply can not leave now daddy all right yes good bye they be both perch bird of course but quite different species the crow be corvus brachyrhynchos and the blackbird be euphagus cyanocephalos thank you you have the number at the fawcett farm right here in this book miss can not see that it make any difference mrs bundy crow or blackbird if the school be attack that be pretty serious hardly think that either species would have sufficient intelligence to launch mass attack their brainpans be not big enough to just come from the school madam do not know anything about their brainpans but well do do know ornithology happen to be my avocation bird be not aggressive creature miss they bring beauty into the world it be mankind rather who sam southern fry chicken bake potato on all of them yes may speak to mitch brenner please yes will wait it be mankind rather who insist upon make it difficult for life to exist upon this planet now if it be not for bird mrs bundy you do not seem to understand this young lady say there be attack on the school impossible oh mitch oh be glad catch you something terrible have ha it be the end of the world bloody marys deke what actually happen at the school bunch of crow attack the school kid it be the end of the world thus saith the lord god unto the mountain and the hill and the river and the valley behold even shall bring sword upon you and will devastate your high place ezekiel chapter woe unto them that rise up early in the morning that they may follow strong drink isaiah chapter it be the end of the world hardly think few bird be go to bring about the end of the world these be not few bird do not know there be many crow in bodega bay this time of year the crow be permanent resident throughout its range in fact during our christmas count we record how many gull do you count mrs bundy which gull mr sholes there be several variety the one who have be play devil with my fishing boat have you have trouble with gull of my boat do last week this young lady be hit by gull only deke be still wait for those bloody marys comin right up can you ask them to low their voice please they be frighten the child whole flock of gull nearly capsize of my boat practically tear the skipper arm off you be scare the kid keep it low all right yeah but he be scarin me too be you tryin to say that all these nah that sound impossible sebastian deke look be just tellin you what happen to of my boat the gull be after your fish mr sholes really let us be logical about this what be the crow after at the school what do you think they be after miss uh daniels think they be after the child for what purpose to kill them why do not know why think not bird have be on this planet miss daniels since archeopteryx year ago do not it seem odd that they would wait all that time to start war against humanity no one call it war scotch light on the water you and mr sholes seem to be imply as much who say anything about war all say some gull want some more coffee no come down on of my boat they can have be after the fish just like you say the captain should have shot at them huh gull be scavenger anyway most bird be get yourselves gun and wipe them off the face of the earth that would hardly be possible why not mrs bundy because there be species of bird in the world today mr carter it be estimate that bird live in the united states alone the continent of the world kill em all get rid of the messy animal probably contain more than bird it be the end of the world those gull must have be after the fish of course hurry up child finish your lunch be the bird gonna eat us mommy hell maybe we be all get little carry away by this admittedly few bird do act strange but that be no reason to believe that keep tell you this be not few bird these be gull crow swift have never know bird of different species to flock together the very concept be unimaginable why if that happen we would not have chance how can we possibly hope to fight them
