ourselves why ecclesiastes tell us man no more know his own time than fish take in the fatal net or bird trap in the snare like these the child of man catch when the time fall suddenly upon them and so before we can heal before we can escape the presence of death and time we must mourn and celebrate theirs with this memorial playing guitar man singing hope you do not think because my name be not
