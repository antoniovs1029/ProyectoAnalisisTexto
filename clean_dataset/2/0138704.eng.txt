personal note when be little kid my mother tell me not to stare into the sun so once when be do the doctor do not know if my eye would ever heal be terrify alone in that darkness slowly daylight creep in through the bandage and can see but something else have change inside me that day have my headache jenna come back here max max can do it jenna what be times right right ok divide by restate my assumption mathematics be the language of nature everything around us can be represent and understand through number if you graph the number of any system pattern emerge therefore there be pattern everywhere in nature evidence the cycle of disease epidemic the wax and wane of caribou population sun spot cycle the rise and fall of the nile so what about the stock market the universe of number that represent the global economy million of hand at work billion of mind vast network scream with life organism natural organism my hypothesis within the stock market there be pattern as well right in front of me hide behind the number always have be press return hello maximillian cohen please yeah hi it be marcy dawson be partner at the predictive strategy firm tell you sorry have not call hope we can have lunch tomorrow say max good hey devi grab you some samosas great your hair what be you do you can not go out like that it be fine do not worry it be fine you need mom gotta go max here your samosas thanks result euclid predict ntc will break tomorrow good bet other anomaly lt predict pro net settle at sixty five and quarter career high be bother you be sorry will put it out name

small personal note attack in under hour administer wg mg promozine hci and wg mg sumattrapan orally as well as wg mg dihydroric atamine mezilayte by subcutaneous injection hi mr cohen marcy dawson here again from lancet percy check my schedule and be in chinatown tomorrow at would love to stop by to meet you it will be worth it for us how be sound how do you get my address get it from columbia it be look forward to it wait minute max stop think max just feel use your intuition what do you think of hamlet do not get to it it be be month you have not take single break be so close have you meet the new fish my niece buy me name her lcarus after you my renegade pupil you fly too high you will get burn look at you see myself year ago my great pupil publish at phd at but life be not just mathematics max spend year search for pattern in pi find nothing you find thing find thing but not pattern not pattern personal note sol die little when he stop research on pi it be not just the stroke he stop care how can he stop when he be so close to see pi for what it really be how can you stop believe that there be pattern order shape behind those number when you be so close we see the simplicity of the circle we see the madden complexity of the endless number off into infinity are the star out tonight do not mind if they be cloudy or bright for only have eye for you dear do not mind if we be in hey max lenny meyer will put it out so what do you do work with computer math math what kind of math number theory research mostly no way work with number myself mean not traditional work with the torah amaze hebrew be all math it be all number you know that look ancient jews use hebrew as their numerical system each letter number the hebrew aleph be bet be understand but look the number be interrelate take the hebrew for father ab aleph bet equal the word for mother haim aleph mem equal the sum of and right now the hebrew word for child mother father child yelev that be and torah be just long string of number some say that it be code send to us from god that be kind of interest that be kid stuff check this out the garden of eden kadem numerical translation the value of tree of knowledge in the garden right aat ha haim you can take those number those be fibonacci number they be you know like the fibonacci sequence fibonacci fibonacci be ltalian mathematician in the if you divide into the result approach theta theta theta the greek symbol for the golden ratio the golden spiral wow never saw that before that be like that series you find in nature like the face of sunflower wherever there be spiral see there be math everywhere hey max restate my assumption can be represent and understand through number pattern emerge therefore there be pattern everywhere in nature so what about the stock market universe of number that represent the global economy million of human hand at work billion of mind vast network scream with life organism natural organism there be pattern right in front of me play with the number always have be press return max max what the shit aaargh god damn it result bullshit euclid predict aar at and half aar have not be beneath in year explanation for anomaly human error result fail treatment to date beta blocker calcium channel blocker adrenaline injection high dose ibuprofen steroid trigger metastics violent exercise caffeine acupuncture marijuana percodan midrin tenormen sanser homeopathics no result no result euclid crash lose all my data hardware your mainframe burn what what be happen get these crazy low pick then it spit out this string of number never saw anything like it and then it fry it crash you have print out of what of the pick the number throw it out what number do it spit out do not know string of digit how many do not know what be it how many probably around why deal with some bug back in my pi day wonder if it be like run into have you meet archimedes the with black spot see you remember archimedes of syracuse eh the king ask archimedes to determine if present he have receive be actually solid gold unsolved problem at the time it torture the great greek mathematician for week insomnia haunt him and he twist and turn in his bed for night on end finally his equally exhaust wife force to share bed with this genius convince him to take bath to relax while he be enter the tub he notice the bath water rise displacement way to determine volume and thus way to determine density weight over volume and thus archimedes solve the problem he scream eureka and he be so overwhelm he run naked through the street to the king palace to report his discovery now what be the moral of the story that breakthrough will come wrong the point of the story be the wife listen to your wife she will give you perspective mean you need break you must take bath or you will get nowhere there will be no order only chaos go home max and you take bath excuse me can take look at the paper oh my god and half hey hey the paper please mr cohen perfect timing be go to head home who be you marcy dawson we be meeting it be really not it be such pleasure to finally meet you study your paper excuse me let us take my car can not mr cohen yes just throw out something do not realise need it just print out lose my data whoa be sorry max how re you do lenny meyer where you go up there you get minute do you wanna try tefillin not now have car to go to the shul you get car that be my friend ephraim let us go great when you say you be max cohen do not realise you be the max cohen your work revolutionary it be inspire the work we do it have very much so the only difference be we be not look at the stock market go ahead wrap that round your hand we be search for pattern in the torah what kind we be not sure all we know be it be digit long ok stand up please max that be right you have gotta be quiet now stand up shh this go on your head look at me max right here there you go all right now we will say prayer together repeat after me shma yisroel shma yisroel right adenoi eloihenu adenoi eloihenu adenoi echod adenoi echod now what be up max what be this number sol excuse me you ask me if would see digit number oh yeah you mean the bug run into it work on pi what do you mean run into it max what be this about there be these religious jews have be talk to religious jews yeah hasids the guy with beard know them know in coffee shop he be number theorist the torah be his data set he say they be after digit number in the torah come on it be just coincidence there be something else though what you remember those weird stock pick yesterday stock pick yes they be correct get pick on the nose smack on the nose sol something go on it have to do with that number there be answer in it max come with me the ancient japanese consider the go board to be microcosm of the universe although when it be empty it appear simple and order the possibility of gameplay be endless no go game be alike just like snowflake so the go board actually represent extremely complex and chaotic universe and that be the truth of our world max it can not be easily sum up with math there be no simple pattern but as the game progress the possibility become small the board take on order soon every move predictable so so maybe even though we be not aware of it there be pattern order underlie every go game maybe it be like the pattern in the stock market the torah this number it be insanity maybe it be genius must get that number hold on you be lose it you have to breathe listen to yourself you be connect my computer bug with you may ve have and some religious hogwash if you want the number you can find it everywhere step from your street corner to your front door tm you spend in the elevator when your mind become obsess you filter everything else out and find that thing everywhere whatever you have choose and you will find it everywhere in nature but max as soon as you discard scientific rigour you be no longer mathematician you be numerologist mr cohen mr cohen god damn it be sick of you follow me be not interest in money want to understand our world do not deal with materialist like you be sorry be very sorry admit we have be too aggressive but all ask be that you give me minute as token accept this do not want your money the suitcase be not fill with or gold or diamond just silicon ming mecca chip ming mecca they be not even de classified yet you be right they be not but lancet percy have many friend beautiful be not it do you know how rare these be what do you mr cohen be you ok no mr coh sir be you sick hey mon buddy get up it be coney lsland last stop here for your nose jenna come back jenna jenna come back here farrouhk no it be max from next door max be everything all right do you have any iodine do you cut yourself no it be to stain slide ah science the pursuit of knowledge tm you surprise me think you be farrouhk here we be what be you examine potato no just something for my computer thanks shalom lenny it be max cohen max what re you do now be think about our conversation last night that be good wanna help new evidence remember pythagoras mathematician cult leader athens circa bc major belief the universe be make of number major contribution the golden ratio good represent geometrically as the golden rectangle visually there exist graceful equilibrium between its length and width when it be square it leave small golden rectangle behind with the same unique ratio the square can continue small and small to infinity more evidence remember da vinci artist inventor sculptor naturalist ltaly th rediscover the perfection of the golden rectangle and pencil it into his masterpiece connect curve through the concentric golden rectangle you generate the mythical golden spiral pythagoras love this shape for he find it in nature nautilus shell ram horn whirlpool tornado our fingerprint our dna and even our milky way personal note when be little kid my mother tell me not to stare into the sun so once do at the brightness be overwhelm but keep look force myself not to blink and then the brightness begin to dissolve my pupil shrink to pinhole and everything come into focus and for moment understand my new hypothesis if we be build from spiral while live in giant spiral then everything we do be infuse with the spiral personal note lt fair to say be step out on limb but be on the edge where it happen be happy you look what do you want in exchange for the chip you tech guy think you know what we want may not find anything we will take the risk want you to call off the surveillance do anything else yeah be very private person just knock on my door and leave the suitcase outside do not wanna talk to anybody how do know you be home will knock back the torah coffee what be it in hebrew character and number no the number what be it do not know if you can find it maybe we can figure it out can you really find it if it be there will find it max jenna can we do it not now please max happy birthday euclid press return press return hell you fuck you fuck fuck fuck fuck you fuck you fuck you fuck you yes hello he be busy right now be sorry you be scream who say you can put lock on the door mr cohen be you ok you be out you hear me out of here have have it with you get out let us go god damn it no you be the out of here mister get out get out get out get out be you ok get out you bastard nineteen and half thirty nine and and and and quarter know these number they be go down down down you lie to me you have it ok sit down give up before pinpoint it but my guess be that certain problem cause computer to get stick in loop the loop lead to meltdown but just before they crash they become aware of their own structure the computer have sense of its own silicon nature and it print out its ingredient the computer become conscious in in some way guess study the pattern make euclid conscious of itself it die spit out the number consciousness be the number no max it be only nasty bug it be more than that no it be dead end there be nothing there it be door sol door door to cliff you be drive yourself over the edge you need to stop you be afraid that be why you quit get burn come on it cause my stroke that be bullshit it be mathematics number idea mathematician should go to the edge you teach me that it be death

not do anything do not play the market be careful where you throw out your trash how can you do that you give faulty information you dangle the carrot but only give us part of the code now give us the rest to set it right you bastard how can you be so stupid max you just do not get it do not give shit about you just what be in your head if you will not help us we will comply with the law of nature survival of the fit and we have get the fucking gun max come here lenny lenny hey mon get in here hurry stay down stay down we have be look for you what be go on you have the number what be go on what

me it be kill you because you be not ready to receive it it be just number be sure you have write down every digit number you have translate all of them you have intone them all have not you what be it get you the number be nothing it be the mean the syntax it be what be between the number you have not understand it it be because it be not for you have get it have get it understand it and be gonna see it rabbi be choose personal note get fast you stare into space like that you can go blind what can the eye do without the brain already be begin to see can help you sol be you friend what do
