choose for the walls red blood red walter voice chapter imagine me if you must as someone you once knew someone perhaps you liked or better yet imagine me as you as kid was top of my class not because liked studying but because realized that an education was my best shot at getting out see the stork dropped me in small dustbowl of town there was not anything wrong with it as far as boring towns go be sure it ranked above average had friends but always felt alone no one ever left but was not gonna die here as much as loved him did not want to be anything like my dad he seemed so distant and sad numbers were his life he was an accountant and guess he had expected me to take over the business he had built but had other plans my mom was tickled pink on my eighth birthday when announced wanted to be detective can not say the same for my father it really put the kibosh on his master plan and it fueled his hatred for the widow dobkins she lived next door it sounds odd but her dog alfie dog bark is the reason became detective the grass is always greener on the other side at least according to alfie that why he was always in our yard and it was my job to catch him but never crossed the fence into the widow dobkins yard that was my father rule on my eighth birthday broke the rule now must admit that my loneliness and obsession with detective stories had fueled fantasies so be not sure of all the details except the widow dobkins was dead it was whole hour before the doctor arrived and in that uncertain hour my eight year old mind raced decided that the widow dobkins was killed by man with deranged mind mind such as our town had never seen before no one would be safe from him not even his loved ones especially his loved ones of course doctor later concluded that it was suicide but never believed it by then my mind had been opened to whole new existence from this detective was born detective fingerling this has promise too hey there you are what are you doing will

exclamation remember this glass shatter walter voice they thought it was the fall he does not remember anything it be not uncommon in cases of such severe head injury he could recover his memory tomorrow or never well of course you have to factor in the history of mental instability of the patient family his own father attempted suicide he just managed to be little more successful at it walter voice because the trauma of laura appeared to be fiction and all that scribbling severe graphomania the rantings of delirious mind some sort of survivor guilt mixed up with numerology obsession you have your hands full doctor mmm will do what can say uh may have this book thank you walter voice my novel my confession never saw it again my name is dr nathaniel some injuries can be healed over
