tomorrow mark the year anniversary since velez air flight explode and crash shortly after takeoff from jfk airport it be disaster that be affect many none more so than mt abraham high school which lose student and faculty member in the crash but it be the event after the crash that have turn this tragic story into something even stranger the survivor who manage to get off the plane before it crash die soon thereafter in series of mysterious and bizarre accident now to some these death be just tragic coincidence but to other they be indication that there be more sinister event take place that be the contention of tonight guest thank you for join us this evening thank you for have me and appreciate you use the word sinister most people say supernatural because they think be talk about ghost and witch and stuff like that here your chance to set the record straight great okay believe that there be sort of force unseen malevolent presence that be all around us every day and it determine when we live and die and some people call this force the devil but think that whole religious thing be so prefer to call it death itself so be surround by death absolutely absolutely every day everywhere all the time and that be what want people to understand that death have this grand design that we all fit into so when alex browning get off that plane and take the other survivor with him he basically screw up death plan and that be what be try to warn people about and the fact that all of the survivor have die be your evidence of this well it be not so much that the survivor die but it be the way that they die mean there be so many weird seemingly random thing about the way they die it just do not make sense and that be the proof there be something out there wait that be not proof that be your interpretation of event that can not be prove in order to support your idea kimberly you should be more open minded what happen after that be just coincidence may finish mere coincidence would have or of these kid die but not all of them include their teacher yes but people die all the time so why should this be any different it force people to question these so called everyday coincidence what if they be something more what if you can do something about it please be you listen to yourself this be crazy you be say we should be on guard every morning when we leave the house that be exactly what be say exactly it and in order to survive the only way to survive be to look beneath the visible world because in the end no one can escape death and today may be your
