claire miss you dr weir report te the lewis clark in docking bay ion drive set thank you head vector degree we be prep for lockdown can not believe it this be ridiculous have not get more than my hand in the last week and now this shit mean why can not we go to mars captain mean mars have get woman smith right neptune there be nothing out there yeah and if the shit go down we will be on our own you know the rule people someone drop the ball we get the call now let us go have you get our course plot in yes sir lock and cock and ready to rock mr justin everything green on my screen skipper start your countdown now ion drive will engage in minus minute thank you lieutenant let us go smith you follow me yes ma am justin get those tank prep yes sir mr cooper skipper ion drive in minute it be time to play spam in the can skipper peter captain miller just want to say this be something clock be tick doctor you wait for personal invitation there mr smith no sir captain do not want to take up doctor if you will just follow the rest of the crew to the grav tank we be almost underway that bunk good be square away mr cooper or you will find yourself walk to neptune what be the hold up peters just load the last of the co scrubber sir you stand right here thanks hat off in the tank sir time in grav couch yeah think your captain have some kind of problem with me oh well do not worry about him he just love have complete stranger on his ship yeah no be this necessary when the ion drive fire you will be take about without tank the force would liquety your skeleton have see the effect on mouse claustrophobic very biiiy be so aione hello be anyone there oh god biiiy be so coid claire be wait you be all right breathe okay dr weir let us get you up okay be fine come on take it easy be fine okay there you go now move nice and slow you have be in stasis for day you be gonna experience little disorientation you understand be all right now thank you okay take that do not rush it all yours you okay doc want some coffee what would you like some coffee no thank you all right suit yourself what about you starck would you like something hot and black inside you be that offer it be not then how about some coffee starck yes sir why be not you on the bridge do you mind if get dress as matter of fact lieutenant do mind if you get dress let us go people we have job to do okay denny here we go happy birthday piay horsey mommy piay horsey hey no more ball in the house you be the who can not catch yo apologize sorry about that mama bear all right all right then peter yes sir do try to find replacement for you but with such short notice it be impossible be sorry talk to my ex he be go to take denny for christmas will get him for the summer so everything all right smitty excuse me lady and gentleman in approximately hour and minute we will be arrive in the orbit of neptune thank you very much thank you that be good all board be green everything by been notify of our position yes sir all right people listen up as you all know we have addition to our crew dr weir you care to join us introduction all around this be my xo lieutenant starck mr justin engineering the funky spaceman over here be mr cooper what exactly be it you do on board this ship coop listen up doc be your good friend okay be the lifesaver and the heartbreaker he be rescue technician this be peters medical technician and my pilot mr smith the gloomy gus in the corner over there that be trauma all right all right now we all know each other skipper get question what the fuck be we do way out here perhaps the good doctor will be kind enough to tell us thank you of all want to say how much appreciate this opportunity to join you on what it be for sure that you appreciate be here doctor but you must understand that we do not we be take off well deserved leave and send into neptune space we be now klicks from the near outpost the last time attempted rescue this far past the outer reach well we lose both ship so if you please right well everything be about to tell you be consider code black by the nsa intercepted radio transmission from decay orbit around neptune the source of this transmission have be identify as the event horizon yeah well that be bullshit for starter skipper you take me off leave thank you so much smitty sit down cooper as you be let the man speak what be make public aboutthe event horizon that she be deep space research vessel that her reactor go critical and that the ship blow up none of that be true the event horizon be the culmination of secret government project to create spacecraft capable of faster than light flight do not excuse me see you can not actually do that the law of relativity prohibit faster than light travel relativity yes we can not break the law of relativity we can go around it the ship do not really go fast than light what it do be it create dimensional gateway that allow it to jump instantaneously from point of the universe to another light year away how well it be difficult to it be all math try us doctor right well use layman term we use rotate magnetic field to focus narrow beam of gravitons these in turn fold space time consistent with weyl tensor dynamics until the space time curvature become infinitely large and you produce singularity now the singularity layman term fuck layman term do you speak english lmagine for minute that this piece of paper excuse me that be vanessa and that be mine attractive piece of paper represent space time and you want to get from point here to there now what be the short distance between point straight line wrong the short distance between point be zero and that be what the gateway do it fold space so that point and point co exist in the same space and time when the spacecraft pass through the gateway space return to normal it be call gravity drive how do you know all this build it well can see why they send you so if the ship do not blow up then what happen well the mission be go perfectly like textbook they reach safe distance use conventional thruster all system look good they have the go ahead to use the gravity drive to open the gateway to proxima centauri and then they just disappear vanish without trace until now where be she be for the last year doctor that be what we be here to find out now we have be unable to verity life contact but tdrs do receive this single transmission what the fucking hell be that listen to this houston pass the same recording through several filter manage to isolate what appear to be human voice be not even sure if it qualify as language latin what mean think it sound like latin can you translate it play it again right there you hear that sound like liberate me something or other can not make out the rest liberate me save me all right station people cross the horizon optimum approach angle be degree come around to head sir make your approach vector negative degree degree we have lock on event horizon navigation beacon she be in the upper ionosphere and it look like we be in for some very heavy chop sir bring us in nice and tight mr smith sir mr justin how be my ship smooth sailing sir match speed on my mark mark range ln and closing sir starck yes sir get on the horn see if anybody be listen this be the us aerospace command vessel lewis ciark hail event horizon event horizon do you read dr weir think you will want to see this where be she dead ahead ln starck anybody home event horizon do you read ln and closing can not see thing ln sir we be get too close where be it the scope be light it be right in front of us ln proximity warning we be right on top of her sir we be gonna hit starck it be right there god reverse thruster full there she be jesus very impressive ship doctor thank you mr smith be you up for flyby yes sir yes would love to that be the main airlock we can dock in there all right smith use the arm and lock us onto that small antenna cluster we should go very carefully here that be not load bearing structure be now doctor everything by lock in to the event horizon thank you smitty light them if you get them thank you very much sir starck give me read the reactor still hot we have get several small radiation source but no leak probably it be nothing serious do they have pressure affirmative the hull intact but there be no gravity and the thermal unit be off line be show deep cold the crew can not survive unless they be in stasis find them starck yeah be already on it captain bio scan on the line there be something wrong with the scan be it radiation interference there be not enough to throw it off be pick up trace life form but can not get lock on their location these reading be all over the ship it do not make any sense okay we do it the hard way deck by deck room by room starck deploy the umbilicus smitty fire up the board in the war room sir mr justin believe you be up for walk yes sir doctor be gonna need you here on the bridge captain do not come out all this way just to sit on your bridge need to be on that ship once we have secure the ship we will bring you on board no be sorry that be unacceptable need to be on that ship once we have secure the ship that be the way it be need you to guide us from the com station this be where need you help us do our job honey honey you forget your briefoase stand clear anything get funky cooper will be on it yo baby bear keep your nose clean showtime video feed be clear be you with us dr weir yes be with you we be cross the umbilicus make our approach to the event horizon you be at the outer airlock door magnetic boot on we have get pressure place be deep freeze we get ice crystal everywhere that be the central corridor that you be in now it connect the personnel area at the front of the ship to engineering at the rear mr justin you take engineering yes sir peter and will take the forward deck doctor what be these yeah have get another over here they be all over the place in emergency they destroy the central corridor and split the ship in half and then the crew can use the foredecks as lifeboat be in medical no casualty place look like it be never be use you stiii have not see any crew if we saw any crew doctor you would know it by now scan for life reading this place be tomb fuck me miiier miiier be you okay look like skipper get case of the willies cooper get back to your post miiier your heart rate just go through the roof be fine think have reach the door to the containment dr weir the engineering deck be on the other side okay let us take look what the hell be this place dr weir it aiiows you to enter the containment without compromise the magnetic fieids look like meat grinder to me be on the bridge get some blood here there must have be coolant leak man this shit be everywhere coolant level on reserve but well within the safety line miss peters can you turn back and leave what be it ship log it be stick it be pretty jam in there what the hell happen to his eye explosive decompression decompression do not do that look iike it be cause by do not know animai or something look at the damage to the soff tissue massive abrasion corpse sicle be scan for life form man be get some really strange reading in here let me see if can get some power up that be the core the gravity drive the heart of the ship justin justin you be break up justin come in what be it do not know the life scan just go off the scale something wrong starck pull him out pull him out shit he be in trouble go coop be go board party sound off this be miller can anybody hear me what the fuck be that pressure emergency we have lose the starboard baffle the hull be breach will contain it here for as long as can get out we be lose atmosphere there be pressure suit in the airlock go here come here come hold on baby bear be almost there almost there get you get watch out watch get you what the fuck be this hold on captain miller captain miller do you copy over smitty where you be all my life we have major situation here sir we have lose the starboard baffle and the hull be breach the safety circuit they have fail do we have time for weld no sir we have get vl of gas leave sir and then we have get nothing the oxygen tank they fail they be break sir we be fucking dead what about the event horizon what she be get air and power it be our only chance there be no way be get on that bastard we do not even know what happen on that ship it beat die mr smith want all personnel on board the event horizon pronto we will meet at the air tank be ahead of you sir bring all thermal unit online hold tight prep for gravity in tm wake up open your eye all right just hang in there dr weir well bring most primary system online for now thank you starck what be our status the antenna array be completely fry we have get no radio no laser no high gain no one come to help us this air taste bad yeah carbon dioxide know it be building up with every breath we take and the co filter on the event horizon be shot so we take the scrubber from the clark that give us what enough breathable air for hour but after that we would good be on our way home be on the port side of the hull approach the dorsal heat sink holy shit captain miller captain miller do you copy over copy mr smith how be my ship sir we have get meter fracture on the outer hull we shouid be abie to repair her but it ii take awfui iot of time sir negative hour we run out of air understand sir what happen here doctor okay how be he his vital sign seem stable but he be unresponsive to stimulus do not know he may wake up in minute he may not wake up at all look skipper know this shit sound weird but mean there be like nothing and then justin appear and it be liquid and the whole core just turn solid it be just not physically possible doctor please please do not start in with that physics shit be tell you saw it mr cooper it would mean the gateway be open that be it the gateway be open the gateway can not be open because the gravity drive be not activate look be tell you what saw doc so it can not just start up by itself mr cooper you be out of line doctor mr justin may die now have to assume that whatever happen to him can happen to all of us mr cooper say he saw something believe he saw something need explanation in my view mr cooper delusional if you do not mind my say so but maybe he saw optical effect cause by gravitational distortion optical effect that be fucking poetic where the fuck cooper be sorry all right gravitational distortion what can create that doctor if somehow burst of gravity wave escape from the core it can distort space time it can make justin seem to disappear it can also have damage the lewis clark however think this be entirely unlikely what be in the core doctor it be complicate how much time do you need we have hour and minute what be in the core this be the gateway now these magnetic ring when they align it create artificial black hole which allow the ship to travel to any point in space black hole the most destructive force in the universe and you have create absolutely yes because we can use that immense power to bend space time look it would take the lewis clark year to reach our near star butthe event horizon can be there in day if it work you can come down it be perfectly safe so if mr justin be suck through your gateway he can ve go wherever the event horizon be theoretically yes but as tell you before the gateway can not just open by itself see lieutenant want this room seal off containment from here on in be off limits yes sir captain there be no danger the gateway contain behind magnetic field it be perfectly safe safe doctor my ship be in piece and of my crewman may not make it home alive no one else go near this thing come on there be get to be something on this log you can do this where be you be up on deck mommy peter what be it you all right what be up you be out there so long think you be try to break my record listen would rather spend the next hour outside than another tm in this shit can it be the final entry in the ship log want to say how proud be of my crew would iike to name my station head chris chambers janice reuben ben fender dick smith we have reach safe distance this be john kilpack ship captain and we be prepare to engage the gravity drive and open the gateway to proxima centauri haii and fareweii what be that will run it through few filter see if can clean it up it be power drain it be the core stay here look after justin do not want anybody else near that thing wait for me doctor what be cause the drain magnetic field be hold maybe short in the fail safe circuit will check it can you give us hand justin justin can you hear me he be come who be come the dark yeah that be the biiiy miller captain miller have get some problem here be with me forever dr weir carbon dioxide can produce hallucination impair judgment god damn it it be not hallucination all right doctor you be in the duct you must have hear something you must have see something do about hour ago saw my son lie on the examination table and in his leg be miss peters crawl if you do not mind my say so it sound little like shock can it be that you be traumatize no no by see the body on the excuse me no have see body before this be different she be right now this be real feel feel heat this be not something that be in our head smitty have you see anything unusual at all no have not see anything and do not need to see anything sir but can tell you this ship be fucked thank you for that scientific analysis mr smith well you do not expect to figure it out do you all right doc when you break all the law of physics you seriously think there will not be price you already kill the last fucking crew and now you want to kill us as well it be just fucking ship all right it be just ship do you understand it be just big hunk of metal there be nothing odd go on fine you all right yeah be just be sorry damn it smitty it be all right that be it fucking that be enough want you calm want you cool now all right you be go back upstairs you be go outside on the clark with cooper and you be go to repair the ship no mistake mistake nobody go home understand yes sir all right sir get move miller what be it starck run the bio scan with the dna rna filter the result be bio reading of indeterminate origin yes know do not you have anything useful to tell me lieutenant have get theory let us hear it think that there be connection between the reading and the hallucination like they be all part of defensive reaction some sort of immune system do not have time to listen to this you have to listen to me to what be say that this ship be react to us and the reaction be get strong it be as if the ship bring back something with it life force of some kind what be you tell me that this ship be alive you want answer and it be the only have get no what want lieutenant be to survive the next hour justin justin do you hear that do you hear that what be that what be it you hear it what do you hear what be it peter listen to me it be all right do not hear anything neither of us hear anything so just calm down all right okay get your breath back okay now tell me be make it stop make it stop open the door stop move no weir stop stop him what re you do in our current environment dr weir self control be asset what be it the forward airlock miller smith cooper anyone in the airlock that be negative starck justin justin do not justin no justin no justin open the door miller come in miiier come in we have emergency what be go on in there starck justin in the airlock say again justin be in the airlock and he be not wear suit shit be on it as you be sailor skipper you need me on this need you right where you be he be engage the override can you shut it down will try come to him starck justin open this door now starck give me status you good hurry he be engage the override and we can not open the inner door will get the kit justin open the door justin open the door do you hear it keep him talk yes yes hear it do you know what it be it show you thing horrible thing what do the dark inside me from the other place will not go back there will not no baby bear come on open the door what be happen do not think she can talk him down she would good if he open the airlock he be go to turn inside out no you stay with me almost get it have almost get it you stay with me justin come on now open that door if you can see the thing have see you would not try to stop me no that be not you talk that be not you talk that be it that be it right there open the door go for that button come on okay no captain justin just activate the door it be on second delay justin stand by for decompression in tm where be hey starck get it fucking open hey open the door can not the inner door will not open when the outside door be trigger it would decompress the entire ship oh my god mama bear open the door come on please captain patch me through to him captain miller tell them to open the door they can not do that justin do not want to die in here you be not gonna die want you to listen to me very carefully and be gonna get you out of there oh my god it be start my eye do not think about them shut them just shut them as tight as you can tm tuck yourself into crouch position make yourself into ball now can not breathe ch god oh god it hurt want you to huff and puff and blow all the air out of your lung do you hear me all the air out of your lung justin do it now okay baby bear get him get him stand by people standby we have get pressure we be come justin we be come be go to need unit here hold his head still okay give me some more glycerin now thing at time iet keep him breathe christ he be bieeding out pressure stiii drop start the drip cc have stop the bleed stabilize him good can he will not be pretty but he should live if we make it back we will make it starck what be our time like co level will become toxic in hour all right peter we have get to find out what happen to the other crew before the same thing happen to us can work on the log on the bridge but will not go back to medical fine yes sir justin say something about the dark inside me what be that mean doctor do not think it mean anything do not you walk away from me mister would like some answer doctor would like to know why of my man try to commit suicide by throw himself out of airlock would like to know what cause that noise look thermal change in the hull can ve cause the metal to expand and contract rapidly cause reverberation this be possible bullshit you build this fucking ship you have give me nothing but bullshit what do you want me to say you say the ship drive create gateway yeah to what do not know where do it go where do you send it do not know where have it be for the last year look do not know do not know be not good enough doctor you be suppose to be the fucking expert need answer that be your job now the other place where be that do not know do not know look there be lot of thing happen around here that do not fully understand need time see well that be exactly what we do not have doctor captain do not ieave me piease for god sake heip me it be in your head it be just in your head god help us be tell you it be his voice hear he be call to me young bosun name eddie corrick we serve on the goliath together when the tank rupture of us make it to the lifeboat but corrick be still on board the goliath when the fire break out you ever see fire in zero gravity it be beautiful it be like liquid it slide all over everything come up in wave and they just keep hit him wave after wave he be scream for me to save him what do you do do the only thing can close the lifeboat hatch and leave him behind swear would never lose another man have know you long time you never tell me that that be just it never tell anybody but this ship know about it it know my fear it know my secret get inside your head and it show you be not go to tell you this have be listen to the distress signal and think make mistake in the translation go on think it say liberate me save me but it be not me it be iiberate tutume save yourself and it get bad there think that say ex inferis save yourself from hell look if what dr weir tell us be true this ship have be beyond the boundary of our universe of know scientific reality who know where it be be what it be see and what it be bring back with it from hell you do not believe in that kind of stuff do you whoever send that message he sure believe in hell captain miiier whatever it be coop it good be good yes sir ready to repressurize the clark and get the heii out of here on my way come on baby do not let me down hello baby papa home she be hold oh shit skipper we be still vent trace gas give me about minute to plug the hole cooper you be the iifesaver minute and we be underway shit get any coffee yeah but it be cold great starck miller we be leave no we can not leave our order be specific rescue the crew salvage what be leave of the ship the crew be dead doctor your ship kill them we come here to do job we be abort doctor starck download the file from the event horizon computer want you to get justin prep and ready to move him back to the clark there be stuff wanna get from medical we would good move him in the tank no problem do it peter yes sir want you to get the co scrubber back into the clark take smitty with you right captain do not do this it be do what about my ship you can not just leave her have no intention of leave her doctor will take the lewis clark to safe distance and then will launch tac missile atthe event horizon until be satisfy she be vaporize fuck this ship captain miller the bio scan just go off the scale it look like the core be drain power from the rest of the ship get the file vacate want off this ship you can not leave she will not let you you just get your gear and get back on the lewis clark doctor or you will find yourself walk home be home let us go ready shot come on ready shot shot okay peter can we go this place be really freak me out yeah you wanna breathe on the way home no do not let us go shit come on we need peter come on get it oh no peters oh god biiiy claire claire it be me be home be home know be not there when you need me and be sorry let my work come between us god claire no be beg you please please do not not again please have be so billy it be all right have be so alone you will never be alone again you be with me now you be with me and have such wonderful wonderful thing to show you damn be good coop coop how long be you go to take cause have get to get the heii out of here look you can kiss my ass smith cause be do just give me to collect my tool and we can get out of dodge minute top roger that weir dr weir weir dr weir get your ass back on board now weir shit captain miller captain miller do you copy over captain miiier captain miiier do you copy over go ahead smitty have just see weir mess around on the clark sir stand by smitty wanna check something out smith get out of there come again sir of the expiosives be miss from the corridor weir may have put it on the clark no no way no sir no way have just put it back together sir get off the clark now smith where the fucking hell be you get you hang on smitty be come no shit where the fuck be go why do this shit get to happen to me fuck all right think coop think think all right get to get back to the ship get to get back to the ship all right gotta blow my air tank will blow my air tank all right fuck this good work this shit good work all right here go all right come on come on yes here come motherfuckers what be that clark go smitty and cooper be dead what what the it be weir you spot him you take him out understand be carefui do not worry about weir will take care of him answer me okay dr weir you do not wanna leave your ship you never will starck it be okay be gonna get you out of here okay easy oh my god what happen to your eye where we be go we will not need eye to see what be you talk about create the event horizon to reach the star but she be go much much further than that she tear hole in our universe gateway to another dimension dimension of pure chaos pure evil when she cross over she be just ship but when she come back she be alive look at her miller be not she beautiful your beautiful ship kill its crew doctor well now she have another crew now she have us what do you think you be do doctor you want to know where the ship have be so now you will find out if you miss me you blow out the hull what make you think will miss that be right be back be shit can not stop hey hey fuck what who the fuck oh shit miller miller give me your hand come on can not be not leave you forward airlock it can not be weir be not take any chance you watch your back yo do not hit me cooper take it off take it off can not breathe can not breathe you be okay you be okay it be over no it be not weir activate the gravity drive we get to shut it down how the bridge be go what about engineering you think you can shut it down from there do not know the process dr weir be the expert do not want to go where the other crew go okay would rather be dead okay okay we blow the fucker up we blow it up do like weir say blow the corridor separate us from the rest of ship use the foredecks as lifeboat with any luck tdrs will pick up our emergency beacon we prep the gravity couch put ourselves in stasis and stand by for search and rescue team meantime be gonna go manually arm these explosive skipper will this shit work it work for dr weir you go activate the emergency beacon you get back here double quick yes sir will come with you you stay here you prep the gravity couch miller close this door behind me lieutenant gateway opening in minus minute emergency beacon activate yes blood oh fuck me fuck me starck run gateway opening in minus minute detonator reiease be authorize the main corridor be now arm we be arm she be ready to blow repeat we be arm she be ready to blow miller miller can you hear me we have to get out of here now you let me burn gateway opening in minus minute miller you leave me behind no you be not edmund corrick watch him die weir the ship bring me back tell you she will not let me leave she will not let anyone leave do you really think you can destroy this ship she be defy space and time she be be to place you can not possibly imagine and now it be time to go back know to hell you know nothing hell be only word the reality be much much bad now let me show you help me no no you see no they be not dead they be not dead not yet you will not take my crew they be not your crew anymore they belong to the ship gateway opening take me you take me you leave them alone no there be no escape the gateway be open and you be all come with me do you see yes see no miller this be rescue we have contact approach the wreckage of the event horizon prepare to board be enter the grav couch bay it do not appear to have be damage in the explosion there appear to be survivor cooper justin lieutenant starck justin seem to have suffer massive injury but he be still alive the grav couch still have power be opening the tank now it be all right it be okay you be safe now justin cooper they be fine they be with us they be with us starck starck stay calm it be all right calm down it be me breathe deeply starck breathe deeply it be the rescue team need sedative here now get you starck get you it be okay need sedative here now starck it be the rescue team we be safe okay okay need it now we be safe
