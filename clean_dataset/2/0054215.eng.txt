prove that well if he open motel on the new highway in say year there must be some proof that exist now something that prove he get that money away from marion somehow what make you sound so certain arbogast he like me sam or he feel sorry for me and he be begin to feel the same way about you can tell the last time talk to him on the phone he would not have go anywhere or do anything without tell us unless he be stop and he be stop so he must have find out something we will start with cabin if he see us we be just take the air bate no shower curtain sam look what be it it be figure it do not get wash down look some figure have be add to or subtract from that prove marion be here it would be too wild coincidence bate never deny she be here well do not that prove that he find out about the money do we simply ask him where he be hide it no but that old woman whoever she be she tell arbogast something want her to tell us the same thing you can not go up there why not bate well let us find him of us can keep him occupy while the other get to the old woman you will never be able to hold him still if he do not want to be hold do not like you go into that house alone can handle sick old
