torrance now come on tony do not be silly do not want to go there how come you do not want to go just do not let us just wait and see we be all go to have real good time bill would like you to meet jack torrance how do you do bill nice to meet you pleasure to meet you grab chair bill join in jack be go to take care of the overlook for us this winter would like you to take him around soon as we be through fine jack be schoolteacher uh formerly schoolteacher what line of work be you in now be writer teaching be more or less way of make end meet this ought to be quite change for you well be look for change our people in denver recommend jack very highly and for once agree with them let us see where be we be about to explain that our season here run from to then we close down completely until the follow may do you mind if ask why you do that it seem to me that the ski up here would be fantastic it would be the problem be the enormous cost it would be to keep the road to sidewinder open it be mile stretch of road it get ln ft of snow during the winter there be just no way to make it economically feasible to keep it clear when the place be build in there be very little interest in winter sport this site be choose for its seclusion and scenic beauty it be certainly get plenty of that that be right do they give you any idea in denver about what the job entail only in very general way well the winter can be fantastically cruel the basic idea be to cope with the very costly damage and depreciation which can occur this consist mainly of run the boiler heat different part of the hotel on daily rotate basis repair damage as it occur and do repair so the element can not get foothold that sound fine to me physically it be not very demand job the only thing that can get bit try here during the winter be tremendous sense of isolation that just happen to be exactly what be look for be outline new write project month of peace be just what want that be very good jack because for some people solitude and isolation can of itself become problem not for me how about your wife and son do you think they will take to it they will love it great well before turn you over to bill there be other thing think we should talk about not to sound melodramatic but it be be know to give few people thought about the job be intrigue do not suppose they say anything in denver about the tragedy we have up here during the winter of do not believe they do we my predecessor in this job hire man name charles grady as the winter caretaker he come up with his wife and little girl of about and he have good employment record good reference and from what have be tell he seem like completely normal individual but at some point during the winter he must have suffer some kind of complete mental breakdown he run amuck and kill his family with axe stack them neatly in room in the west wing and then he put both barrel of his shotgun in his mouth the police think that it be what the old timer use to call cabin fever kind of claustrophobic reaction which can occur when people be shut in together over long period of time wow that be quite story yeah it be it be still hard for me to believe it actually happen here but it do and uh think you can appreciate why want to tell you about it certainly can also understand why your people in denver leave it for you to tell me obviously some people can be put off from stay in place where something like that happen you can rest assure that be not go to happen with me and as far as my wife be concern be sure she will be absolutely fascinate when tell her she be confirm ghost story and horror film addict tony do you think dad get the job he already do he be go to phone wendy up in few minute to tell her hello hi babe hi hon how be it go great be at the hotel and still have lot to go through do not think can get home before or sound like you get the job right it be beautiful place you and danny be go to love it tony why do not you want to go to the hotel do not know you do too know now come on tell me do not want to please no now tony tell me now hold your eye still so can see that be good now the other good

anything to worry about be quite sure there be nothing physically wrong with danny yeah oh he seem absolutely fine now but you should ve see him know kid can scare you to death but believe me these episode be not at all uncommon and they look much bad than they be but what be the matter with him most of the time these episode with kid be never explain they be bring on by emotional factor and rarely occur again they be more akin to autohypnosis kind of self induced trance if it reoccur which doubt we can always think about have some test do no thank you be sure you be right have you be in boulder long only about month we be from vermont my husband be teaching school there do the appearance of danny imaginary friend tony do tony appearance happen to coincide with your arrival here no um let us see guess danny start talk to tony about the time we put him in nursery school do he adjust well to school no he do not like it too much at then he have injury so we keep him out for while and yeah guess that be about when notice he be talk to tony what sort of injury do he have he dislocate his shoulder how do he manage to do that it be just of those thing you know purely accident my husband have be drink and he come home about hour late so he be not exactly in the great mood that night and danny have scatter some of his school paper all over the room and my husband grab his arm to pull him away from them it be just the sort of thing you do times with child you know in park or in the street but on this particular occasion my husband just use too much strength and he injure
