host man get into this this be pretty graphic stuff so let me star by ask why you spend so much time investigate such grisly content fame and money no be just kid the honest answer be that be really drive by sense of injustice when think about the awful thing that happen to these people and that those responsible be never even identify let alone catch mean know when start this particular case that may stumble on few thing that maybe somebody would overlook host might no you in fact do uncover some additional information that the cop have overlook well look off there be lot of good police officer out there and do not wanna in any way disparage what they do right but in police work get something wrong mean ruin people life good crime write can set thing right so ultimately what feel good seeing justice do or see your book kentucky blood number on the new york times bestseller list the justice without question would rather cut my hand off than write book for fame or money sigh be

but be not some local moron do not say you be you know have degree in criminology have take my fair share of forensic science course also know series of connect murder when see mr oswalt look we miss something get that but if you want me to run interference for you while you get this work out gotta be in the loop just little bit you really wanna help it be my home mr oswalt what happen here happen to all of us all right come here who be that do not know that be what be hope to find out you think these be serial murder maybe more ritualize than necessarily serial but really spread out and not just regionally but over time the date back to the the yeah that would put the guy what in his yeah or his yeah do not know well look at the methodology toxicology report some case the killer drug his victim with what well they can not tell for sure but by drug them the killer remove his need to overpower them here he use tree branch to do the heavy lift in sacramento he light family on fire in st louis he slit their throat the family he drown drown you you never say anything about anyone be drown the only other significant link between the murder case be that in each instance the killer murder the entire family except child which he take with him that and this symbol appear in several of the crime scene that look like something from out of the occult look you may wanna call the university there be professor over there professor jonas he be occult crime expert and the state police bring him in on some of the the weird stuff think this qualify sigh so where do you think that drown happen that be what need you to find out ok ringing professor jonas yes hello hey thank you for get back to me so quickly appreciate that of course be really big fan be flatter that you email once saw the photo that you send know exactly what case you be study wait how would you know what case be look at the symbol that you send me be be not pentagram it be not something that you would see teenager or norwegian black metal band paint on wall in goat blood to be edgy right or to piss off the christians no this be little bit more obscure than that know the in the hallway that be from the late in st louis the other the the car hood that be from sacramento that be about year ago tell me about the in sacramento it be symbol associate with the worship of pagan deity deity what kind of deity very obscure date back to babylonian time named bughuul the eater of child do you say eater yes of child thank you jessica the crime that you be deal with they all have the element of miss child correct yes yeah that be correct well bughuul eat child now the fragment of story that have survive they all revolve around him need the soul of human child to survive now each story involve different way that he lure or trick these child away from the physical world and trap them in his own netherworld and he consume their soul over time now any worship of this deity would include blood sacrifice or the wholesale eat of child so you be say the person that make this symbol be be eat child well that would fit the story of course the few time that this symbol have show up none of the crime have be relate in any way to any of this so this may be more of cult initiation rather than you know the actual action of any man there be be another have not there think so yes tell me everything you can film whirs door bangs light thud floorboard creaks floorboard creaks film whirs shh appreciate you come by officer oh yeah it be not problem at all so we be become friend right suppose yeah mean can trust you right yeah absolutely so if be to ask you something in earnest you would not read too much into it um all right be there anything weird about the stevensons no complaint from them about anything strange no not to my knowledge the investigator do they notice anything odd or inexplicable about the house any any weird story no mr oswalt be there something that you wanna tell me clearly something happen and you wanna talk to somebody about it right yeah ok well do your wife know about it wait do she know whose house this be be laugh oh man oh that be conversation that would not wanna be around for no me neither be sorry so so what you saw something weird hear something spooky in the house yes precisely what exactly now do not believe in any you know stuff stuff you mean the supernatural the metaphysical the paranormal that type of stuff right right of course you do not you never would have move into crime scene if you do but here we be have this conversation yeah but but there be there be none of that you know none of that with the stevensons huh no in the short amount of time that the stevensons live here they never call the police they never have the police call on them or report anything bizarre that come up in the investigation do you wanna know what think yes sigh think that you move yourself into the house of murder victim and immediately set about try to

engraving old sketch from the dark ages and fragment of deteriorate fresco there be not lot leave everything else have be destroy why well superstition early christians believe that bughuul actually live in the image themselves and that they be gateway into his realm gateway yes the ancient church believe that he would take possession of those who saw the image and cause them to do terrible ming or in some case he can even abduct the viewer into the image themselves children expose to the image be especially vulnerable to bughuul possession and or abduction what if you destroy em sorry do not follow if you destroy the image with fire what would happen then what do you mean literally or in the story in the story if image be destroy then the gateway would be close and bughuul would no longer have access to this world right mr oswalt what kind of book be you write exactly do not know be not even sure have book any more but thank you for your time anytime ringtone all right ringtone you
