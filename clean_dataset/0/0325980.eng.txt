this be aztec gold of identical piece they deliver in stone chest to cortés blood money pay to stem the slaughter he wreak upon them with his army blood money pay to stem the slaughter he wreak upon them with his army but the greed of cortés be insatiable so the heathen god place upon the gold terrible curse any mortal that remove but single piece from that stone chest shall be punish for eternity shall be punish for eternity hardly believe in ghost story any more captain barbossa aye that be exactly what think when we be tell the tale bury on island of the dead what can not be find except for those who know where it be find it we do there be the chest inside be the gold and we take em all we spend em and trade em and fritter em away on drink and food and pleasurable company the more we give em away the more we come to realize the drink would not satisfy food turn to ash in our mouth food turn to ash in our mouth and all the pleasurable company in the world can not slake our lust we be curse man miss turner compel by greed we be but now we be consume by it there be way we can end our curse all the scatter piece of the aztec gold must be restore and the blood repay thanks

everything equal share the location of the treasure too so jack give up the bearing that night there be mutiny they maroon jack on island and leave him to die but not before he would go mad with the heat so that be the reason for all the reason get nothing to do with it when pirate maroon he be give pistol with single shot shot that will not do much good hunting nor to be rescue but after week of starve belly and thirst that pistol look real friendly but jack escape the island and still have that single shot he will not use it though save on man his mutinous mate barbossa aye how do jack get

to be trap here jack well it bloody be now there will be no live with her after this but we have get to save will no you be safe now we will return to port royal immediately not go gallivant after pirate then we condemn him to death the boy fate be regrettable but so be his decision to engage in piracy to rescue me to prevent anything from happen to me if may be so bold as to interject my professional opinion the pearl be listing to scupper after the battle she will not make good time think about it the black pearl the last real pirate threat in the caribbean mate how can you pass that up by remember that serve other mr sparrow not only myself commodore beg you please do this for me as wedding gift elizabeth be you accept the commodore proposal be wedding love wedding drink all

locker it be only after that we learn we need his blood to lift the curse that be what you call ironic bring him do not care for the situation any attempt to storm the cave can turn into ambush not if you be the do the ambush go in and get barbossa to send his man out in their little boat your mate return to the dauntless and blast them with your cannon what do you have to lose nothing would lament be rid of now to be honest there be risk to those aboard the dauntless which include the future mrs commodore it be for your own safety do not care have to tell him the pirate be curse they can not be
