everything will it be for the great good or will it be use for personal or for destructive end now this be question we must all ask ourselves why because we be mutant for psychic this present particular problem when be it acceptable to use our power and when do we cross that invisible line that turn us into tyrant over our fellow man but einstein say that ethics be exclusive human concern without any superhuman authority behind it einstein be not mutant so far as we know this case study be send to me by colleague dr moira mctaggert jones the man you see here be bear with no higher level brain function his organ and nervous system work but he have no consciousness to speak of what if we be to transfer the consciousness of person say father of with terminal cancer into the body of this man how be we to decide what fall within the range of ethical behavior and what professor we will continue this tomorrow class dismiss the forecast be for sunny sky be sorry do not have to be
