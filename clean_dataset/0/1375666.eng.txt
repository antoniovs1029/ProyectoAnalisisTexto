because you know give it to you the subject mind can always trace the genesis of the idea true inspiration impossible to fake that be not true can you do it be you offering me choice because can find my own way to square thing with cobol then you do have choice then choose to leave sir tell the crew where you want to go hey mr cobb how would you like to go home to america to your child you can not fix that no one can just like inception cobb come on how complex be the idea simple enough no idea be simple when you need to plant it in somebody else mind my main competitor be old man in poor health his son will soon inherit control of the corporation need him to decide to break up his father empire cobb we should walk away from this hold on if be to do this if even can do it would need guarantee how do know you can deliver you do not but can so do you want to take leap of faith or become old man fill with regret wait to die alone assemble your team mr cobb and choose your people more wisely look know how much you wanna go home this can not be do yes it can just have to go deep enough you do not know that have do it before who would you do it to why be we go to paris we be gonna need new architect you never do like your office do you no space to think in that broom cupboard be it safe for you to be here extradition between france and the united states be bureaucratic nightmare you know that think they may find way to make it work in your case look uh bring these for you to give to the kid when you have chance it will take more than the occasional stuff animal to convince those child they still have father be just do what know be do what you teach me never teach you to be thief no you teach me to navigate people mind but after what happen there be not whole lot of legitimate way for me to use that skill what be you do here dom think find way home it be job for some very very powerful people people who believe can fix my charge permanently but need your help you be here to corrupt of my bright and good you know what be offering let them decide for themselves money not just money you remember it be the chance to build cathedral entire city thing that never exist thing that can not exist in the real world so you want me to let someone else follow you into your fantasy they do not actually come into the dream they just design the level and teach them to the dreamer that be all design it yourself mal will not let me come back to reality dom please reality those kid your grandchild they be wait for their father to come back home that be their reality and this job this last job that be how get there would not be stand here if know any other way need architect who be as good as be have get somebody good ariadne would like you to meet mr cobb please to meet you if you have few moment mr cobb have job offer he would like to discuss with you work placement not exactly have test for you you be not gonna tell me anything before describe the job have to know you can do it why it be not strictly speak legal you have minute to design maze that it take minute to solve stop again stop you be gonna have to do good than that that be more like it they say we only use fraction of our brain true potential now that be when we be awake when we be asleep our mind can do almost anything such as imagine you be design building you consciously create each aspect but sometimes it feel like it be almost create itself if you know what mean yeah like be discover it genuine inspiration right now in dream our mind continuously do this we create and perceive our world simultaneously and our mind do this so well that we do not even know it be happen that allow us to get right in the middle of that process how by take over the create part now this be where need you you create the world of the dream we bring the subject into that dream and they fill it with their subconscious how can ever acquire enough detail to make them think that it be reality well dream they feel real while we be in them right it be only when we wake up that we realize something be actually strange let me ask you question you never really remember the begin of dream do you you always wind up right in the middle of what be go on guess yeah so how do we end up here well we just come from the uh think about it ariadne how do you get here where be you right now we be dream you be in the middle of the workshop sleep this be your lesson in share dream stay calm if it be just dream then why be you because it be never just dream be it and face full of glass hurt like hell when you be in it it feel real that be why the military develop dream share it be training program for soldier to shoot stab and strangle each other and then wake up how do architect become involve well someone have to design the dream right why do not you give us another minute minute what we be talk for like at least hour in dream your mind function more quickly therefore time seem to feel more slow minute in the real world give you hour in the dream why do not you see what you can get up to in minute you have get the basic layout bookstore cafe almost everything else be here too who be the people projection of my subconscious yours yes remember you be the dreamer you build this world be the subject my mind populate it you can literally talk to my subconscious that be of the way we extract information from the subject how else do you do it by create something secure like bank vault or jail the mind automatically fill it with information it be try to protect you understand then you break in and steal it well guess think that the dream space would be all about the visual but it be more about the feel of it my question be what happen when you start mess with the physics of it all it be something be not it yes it be why be they all look at me because my subconscious feel that someone else be create this world the more you change thing the quick the projection start to converge on you converge they sense the foreign nature of the dreamer they attack like white blood cell fight infection what they be gonna attack us no no just you this be great but be tell you if you keep change thing like this jeez mind tell your subconscious to take it easy it be my subconscious remember can not control it very impressive know this bridge this place be real be not it yeah cross it every day to get to the college never re create place from your memory always imagine new place you draw from stuff you know right only use detail streetlamp or phone booth never entire area why not building dream from your memory be the easy way to lose your grasp on what be real and what be dream be that what happen to you listen to me this have nothing to do with me understand that why you need me to build your dream hey get off of her back up back up cobb cobb get off of her let me go let me go mal mal cobb wake me up wake me up wake me up no mal no no wake me up hey hey hey look at me you be okay you be okay hey why would not wake up there be still time on the clock you can not wake up from within the dream unless you die what totem it be small personal that be some subconscious you have get on you cobb she be real charmer oh see you meet mrs cobb she be his wife yeah so totem you need small object potentially heavy something you can have on you that no one else know like coin no it need to be more unique than that like this be load die no can not let you touch it that would defeat the purpose see only know the balance and the weight of this particular load die that way when you look at your totem you know beyond doubt that you be not in someone else dream do not know if you can not see what be go on or if you just do not want to but cobb have some serious problem that he be try to bury down there and be not about to just open my mind to someone like that she will be back have never see anyone pick it up that quickly before reality not gonna be enough for her now and when she come back when she come back you be gonna have her building maze where be you gonna be gotta go visit eames eames no he be in mombasa it be cobol back yard it be necessary risk well there be plenty of good thief we do not just need thief we need forger rub them together all you want they be not gonna breed you never know be gonna get you drink you be buy your spell have not improve piss off how be your handwriting it be versatile good thank you very much inception now before you bother tell me it be impossible let me no it be perfectly possible it be just bloody difficult interest because arthur keep tell me it can not be do hmm arthur you still work with that stick in the mud he be good at what he do right oh he be the good but he have no imagination not like you listen if you be gonna perform inception you need imagination let me ask you something have you do it before we try it uh we get the idea in place but it do not take you do not plant it deep enough no it be not just about depth you need the simple version of the idea in order for it to grow naturally in your subject mind it be subtle art so what be this idea that you need to plant we need the heir of major corporation to dissolve his father empire right there you have various political motivation and anti monopolistic sentiment and so forth but all of that stuff it be um it be really at the mercy of your subject prejudice you see what you have to do be start at the absolute basic which be what the relationship with the father do you have chemist no not yet right okay well there be man here yusuf he uh formulate his own version of the compound why do not you take me there once you have lose your tail the man at the bar cobol engineering that price on my head be that dead or alive do not remember let us see if he start shoot run interference will meet you downstairs in the bar in say uh half hour back here this be the last place they would suspect all right freddy freddy simmonds my god it be you be not it no it be not you not dream now be you get him there cafe shh cafe cafe care for lift mr cobb what be you do in mombasa be here to protect my investment ah so this be your idea of lose tail huh different tail cobb say you would be back try not to come but but there be nothing quite like it it be just pure creation shall we take look at some paradoxical architecture you be gonna have to master few trick if you be gonna build complete dream level excuse me what kind of trick in dream you can cheat architecture into impossible shape that let you create close loop like the penrose steps the infinite staircase see paradox so close loop like that will help you disguise the boundary of the dream you create but how big do these level have to be it can be anything from the floor of building to entire city they have to be complicate enough that we can hide from the projection maze right maze and the good the maze then the long we have before the projection catch us exactly my subconscious seem polite enough ha ha you wait they will turn ugly no one like to feel someone else mess around in their mind cobb can not build anymore can he do not know if he can not but he will not he think it be safe if he do not know the layout why he will not tell me but think it be mal his ex wife no not his ex they be still together no no she be dead what you see in there be just his projection of her what be she like in real life she be lovely you be seek chemist yes to formulate compound for job and to go into the field with us no rarely go into the field mr cobb well we would need you there to tailor compound specific to our need which be great depth dream within dream level not possible that many dream within dream be too unstable it be possible you just have to add sedative powerful sedative how many team member the only way to know you have do the job be if go in with you there be no room for tourist on job like this mr saito this time it seem there be this think be good place to start use it every day what for here will show you perhaps you will not want to see after you all connect bloody hell they come every day to share the dream you see very stable how long do they dream for hour each day in dream time with this compound about hour each and every day why do they do it tell him mr cobb after while it become the only way you can dream do you still dream mr cobb they come here every day to sleep no they come to be wake up the dream have become their reality who be you to say otherwise sir let us see what you can do you know how to find me you know what you have to do sharp no be you all right mr cobb yeah yeah everything just fine robert fischer heir to the fischer morrow energy conglomerate what be your problem with this mr fischer that be not your concern mr saito this be not your typical corporate espionage you ask me for inception do hope you understand the gravity of that request now the seed that we plant in this man mind will grow into idea this idea will define him it may come to change well it may come to change everything about him we be the last company stand between them and total energy dominance and we can no longer compete soon they will control the energy supply of half the world in effect they become new superpower the world need robert fischer to change his mind that be where we come in how be robert fischer relationship with his father rumor be the relationship be quite complicate well we can not work base solely on rumor can we can you get me access to this man here brown fischer senior right hand man fischer junior godfather it should be possible if you can get the right reference reference be something of specialty for me mr saito be not smell settlement here take them down mr browning maurice fischer policy be always of avoid litigation well shall we voice your concern with maurice directly not sure that be necessary no no no think we should how be he do not want to bother him unnecessarily but robert tell you keep out the damn wait so do it get mr fischer put it through never never never do the same as ask leave that here must be cherish memory of his put it beside his bed he have not even notice robert we need to talk about power of attorney know this be hard but it be imperative not now uncle peter the vulture be circle and the sick maurice fischer become the more powerful peter browning become have have ample opportunity to observe browning and adopt his physical presence study his mannerism and so on and so forth so now in the layer of the dream can impersonate browning and suggest concept to fischer conscious mind then when we take him level deep his own projection of browning should feed that right back to him so he give himself the idea precisely that be the only way it will stick it have to seem self generated eames be impress your condescension as always be much appreciate arthur thank you be you go under on your own no no be just uh run some experiment do not realize anyone be here so yeah be just be work on my totem actually here let me take look so you be learn huh elegant solution for keep track of reality be it your idea no it be uh it be mal actually this this be hers she would spin it in the dream and it would never topple just spin and spin arthur tell me she pass away how be the maze come along each level relate to the part of the subject subconscious that we be try to access so be make the bottom level hospital so fischer will bring his father you know actually have question about this layout no no no do not show me specific only the dreamer should know the layout why be that so important in case of us bring in our projection we do not want them know the detail of the maze you mean in case you bring mal in you can not keep her out can you right you can not build because if you know the maze then she know it well she would sabotage the whole operation cobb do the other know no no they do not you have gotta warn them if this be get bad no one say it be get bad need to get home that be all care about right now why can not you go home because they think kill her thank you for what for not ask whether do will split up my father empire now this be obviously idea that robert himself would choose to reject which be why we need to plant it deep in his subconscious the subconscious be motivate by emotion right not reason we need to find way to translate this into emotional concept how do you translate business strategy into emotion that be what we be here to figure out robert relationship with his father be stress to say the least can we run with that we suggest break up his father company as screw you to the old man no because think positive emotion trump negative emotion every time we all yearn for reconciliation for catharsis we need robert fischer to have positive emotional reaction to all this all right well try this um my father accept that want to create for myself not follow in his footstep that may work may we be gonna need to do little good than may thank you for your contribution arthur forgive me for want little specificity eames specificity inception not about be specific when we get inside his mind we be gonna have to work with what we find on the top level we open up his relationship with his father and say will not follow in my father footstep then the next level down we feed him will create something for myself then by the time we hit the bottom level we bring out the big gun my father do not want me to be him exactly layer down the dream be gonna collapse with the slight disturbance sedation for sleep stable enough to create layer of dream we will have to combine it with extremely powerful sedative good night the compound we will be use to share the dream create clear connection between dreamer whilst accelerate brain function in other word more time on each level brain function in the dream will be about times normal and when you enter dream within that dream the effect be compound it be dream that be hour time math be never my strong subject how much time be that it be week the level down month the level down and the level that be year who would wanna be stick in dream for year depend on the dream so once we have make the plant how do we get out be hope you have something more elegant than shoot me in the head kick what be kick this ariadne would be kick it be that feel of fall you get that jolt you awake snap you out of the dream we gonna feel kick with this sedation that be the clever part customize the sedative to leave inner ear function unimpaired that way however deep the sleep the sleeper still feel fall or tip the trick be to synchronize kick that can penetrate all level we can use musical countdown to synchronize the different kick he have not get any surgery schedule no dental nothing be not he suppose to have knee operation nothing nothing that they will put him under for anyway and we need we need at least good hour sydney to los angeles of the long flight in the world he make it every week he must be fly private then not if there be unexpected maintenance with his plane it would have to be why that on the pilot up top the first class cabin in the nose so no one would walk through you would have to buy out the entire cabin and the first class flight attendant buy the airline it seem neat well look like we have our hour ariadne terrific work by the way you know how to find me you know what you have to do you remember when you ask me to marry you of course do you say you have dream that we would grow old together and we can you should not be here just want to see what kind of test you be do on your own every night this have nothing to do with you this have everything to do with me you have ask me to share dream with you not these these be my dream why do you do this to yourself it be the only way can still dream why be it so important to dream in my dream we be still together these be not just dream these be memory and you say never to use memory know do you be try to keep her alive you can not let her go you do not understand these be moment regret they be memory that have to change well what be down there that you regret listen there be only thing you need to understand about me this be your house mine and mal yes where be she she be already go that be my son james he be dig for something maybe worm that be phillipa think about call out to them so they would turn and smile and can see those beautiful face of theirs but it be all too late right now or never cobb then start to panic realize be gonna regret this moment that need to see their face last time james phillipa come on in but the moment past and whatever do can not change this moment as be about to call out to them they run away if be ever gonna see their face again have gotta get back home the real world what be you do here my name be know who you be what be

you say we would be together you say we would grow old together will come back for you promise do you think you can just build prison of memory to lock her in do you really think that that be gonna contain her it be time maurice fischer just die in sydney when the funeral in los angeles robert should accompany the body no late than we should move all right cobb be come with you promise miles no the team need someone who understand what you be struggle with and it do not have to be me but then you have to show arthur what just saw get us another seat on the plane if get on this plane and you

come on there be in there the wallet worth more than that you may at least drop me at my stop be afraid that it do not cover him down down now what the hell be go on this be not in the design cobb cobb get him be you all right yeah be okay be okay fischer okay unless he get carsick saito get fischer in the back room now what the hell happen have he be shot be he die do not know jesus christ what happen to you block by freight train why put train in downtown intersection where would it come from why the hell be we ambush those be not normal projection they would be train for god sake how can he be train fischer have extractor teach his subconscious to defend itself so his subconscious be militarize it should ve show in the research why the hell do not it calm down do not tell me to calm down this be your job goddamn it this be your responsibility you be mean to check fischer background we be not prepare for this we have deal with sub security before we will be more careful and we be gonna be fine this be not part of the plan he be die put him out his misery no do not do that do not do that cobb hey hey he be in agony be wake him up no it will not wake him up what do you mean it will not wake him up when we die in dream we wake up not from this we be too heavily sedate to wake up that way right so what happen when we die we drop into limbo be you serious limbo unconstructed dream space well what the hell be down there just raw infinite subconscious nothing be down there except for what may have be leave behind by anyone share the dream who be be trap there before which in our case be just you how long can we be stick can not even think about try to escape until the sedation how long decade it can be infinite ask him he be the who be be there let us get him upstairs great thank you so now we be trap in fischer mind battle his own private army and if we get kill we will be lose in limbo till our brain turn to scramble egg hmm someone get aid you know these risk and do not tell us there be not mean to be risk do not know we would be deal with gunfire you have no right this be the only way to go layer deep you know about this and go along with it trust him when when he promise you half his share no his whole share besides he say he would do it before what with mal because that work so good that have nothing to do with it do what have to to get to my child you lead us into war zone with no way out there be way out we continue on with the job and we do it as fast as possible and we get out use the kick just like before forget it we go any deep we just raise the stake be sit this out on this level fischer security be surround this place hour of flight time be week at this level that mean each and every of us will be kill that can guarantee you we have no other choice but to continue on and do it as fast as possible downwards be the only way forwards get ready you come on let us go shake him up be insure against kidnapping for up to shut up it will not be in your father office below the bookshelf be his personal safe we need the combination do not know any safe that do not mean you do not know the combination tell us what it be do not know we have it on good authority you do know yeah whose authority usd this cost what be inside it cash card ld and this useful maybe you be on you have get hour hour be suppose to have all night to crack this and saito be not suppose to be shot in the chest you have get hour now get us something useful please what be that good authority uncle peter just make them stop the combination do not know it why do browning say you do do not know just let me talk to him and will find out you have hour start talk you all right you okay those bastard have have at me for day they have someone with access to your father office they be try to open his safe yeah they think would know the combination but do not know it yeah well neither do so what maurice tell me that when he pass you be the only able to open it no he never give me any combination maybe he do mean maybe you just do not know it be combination well what then do not know some meaningful combination of number base on your experience with maurice we do not have very many uh meaningful experience together perhaps after your mother die after my mother die you know what he tell me robert there be really nothing to be say oh well he be bad with emotion be uncle peter how be he do he be in lot of pain when we get down to the low level the pain will be less intense and if he die worst case scenario when he wake up his mind be completely go cobb will still honor the arrangement appreciate that saito but when you wake up you will not even remember that we have arrangement limbo be gonna become your reality you be gonna be lose down there so long that you be gonna become old man fill with regret wait to die alone no will come back and we will be young man together again breathe these people be gonna kill us if we do not give them the combination they just wanna ransom us hear them they be gonna lock us in that van and then drive it into the river all right what be in the safe something for you maurice always say it be his most precious gift to you will maurice will be with port and dunn that be alternate this would supersede the other if you want it to it split up the component business of fischer morrow it would be the end of the entire empire as we know it destroy my whole inheritance why would he suggest such thing just do not know he love you robert in his own way in his own way at the end he call me in to his deathbed he can barely speak but he take the trouble to tell me last thing he pull me close and can only make out word disappoint when be you in limbo you may have the rest of the team convince to carry on with this job but they do not know the truth truth what truth the truth that at any minute you may bring freight train through the wall the truth that mal be burst through your subconscious and the truth that as we go deep into fischer we be also go deep into you and be not sure we be gonna like what we find we be work together we be explore the concept of dream within dream keep push thing want to go deep and deep want to go further just do not understand the concept that hour can turn into year down there that we can get trap so deep that when we wind up on the shore of our own subconscious we lose sight of what be real we create we build the world for ourselves we do that for year we build our own world how long be you stick there something like year jesus how can you stand it it be not so bad at feel like god eventually it just become impossible for me to live like that and what about for her she have lock something away something deep inside her truth that she have once know but choose to forget limbo become her reality what happen when you wake up well to wake up from that after year after decade to become old soul throw back into youth like that know something be wrong with her she just would not admit it eventually she tell me the truth she be possess by idea this very simple idea that change everything that our world be not real that she need to wake up to come back to reality that in order to get back home we have to kill ourselves what about your child she think they be projection that our real child be wait for us up there somewhere be their mother calm down can tell the difference if this be my dream why can not control this you do not know you be dream she be certain there be nothing can do no matter how much beg no matter how much plead she want to do it but she can not do it alone she love me too much so she come up with plan on our anniversary sweetheart what be you do join me just just step back inside all right just step back inside now come on no be go to jump and you be come with me no be not now you listen to me if you jump you be not gonna wake up remember you be gonna die now just step back inside
