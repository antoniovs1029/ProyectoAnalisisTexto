golden age of espionage where human intelligence be the only resource available well find this rather old fashioned belief demonstrate reckless disregard for excuse me minister do not mean to

no longer know to us they do not exist on map they be not nation they be individual look around you who do you fear can you see face uniform flag no our world be not more transparent now it be more opaque it be in the shadow that be where we must do battle so before you declare us irrelevant ask yourselves how safe do you feel have just more thing to say my late husband be great lover of poetry and um suppose some of it sink in despite my good intention and here today remember this think from tennyson we be not now that strength which in old day move earth and heaven that which we be we be equal temper of heroic heart make weak by time and fate but strong in will to strive to seek to find and not to yield go go go go move move go move what the hell be we do be you kidnapping me that
