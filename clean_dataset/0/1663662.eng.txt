when be kid whenever would feel small or lonely would look up at the star wondered if there be life up there turns out be look in the wrong direction when alien life enter our world it be from deep beneath the pacific ocean fissure between tectonic plate portal between dimension the breach be when the kaiju make land in san francisco by the time tank jet and missile take it down day and ln mi late city be destroy tens of thousand of life be lose we mourn our dead memorialize the attack and move on and then only month late the attack hit manila the acid factor of the kaiju blood create toxic phenomenon name kaiju blue and then the hit cabo and then the and then we learn this be not gonna stop this be just the begin we need new weapon the world come together pool its resource and throw aside old rivalry for the sake of the great good to fight monster we create monster of our own the jaeger program be bear there be setback at the neural load to interface with jaeger prove too much for single pilot two pilot system be implement left hemisphere right hemisphere pilot control we start win jaegers stop kaijus everywhere but the jaegers be only as good as their pilot so jaeger pilot turn into rock star danger turn into propaganda kaijus into toy we get really good at it winning then then it all change gipsy danger report to bay level kaiju code name knifehead category wg tm yo yancy wake up movement in the breach hey come on we be be deploy great good morning morning kaiju category big yet code name knifehead what time be it yep what do you say notch on the belt come on beckets time for the drop hey kid yeah do not get cocky years before you would not have pick my brother yancy and for hero no chance all right let us suit up and kick some ass we be never star athlete never at the head of the class but we can hold our own in fight and it turn out we have unique skill we be drift compatible data on helmet data relay gel disperse in circuitry suit good morning becket boy tendo what be happen my man how would that date with alison go last night mr choi oh she love me her boyfriend not so much you be gonna get your ass kick ha ha man gotta do what man gotta do brother engage drop mr choi engage drop sir marshal pentecost on deck secure the conn pod get ready to drop conn pod door lock secure release for drop gipsy danger ready for the big drop here we go yeah here we go couple confirm sir engage pilot to pilot protocol engaging now pilot to pilot connection protocol sequence gipsy launch bay gipsy danger ready and align sir ranger this be marshal stacker pentecost prepare for neural handshake start in tm fourteen thirteen eleven ready to step into my head kid please after you age before beauty old man pilot to pilot connection protocol sequence neural handshake initiate the drift jaeger tech based on darpa jet fighter neural system pilot mind melding through memory with the body of giant machine the deep the bond the good you fight neural handshake strong and hold right hemisphere be calibrate leave hemisphere calibrate proofed and transmit gentlemen your order be to hold the miracle mile off anchorage copy copy that sir sir there be still civilian vessel in the gulf you be protect city of people you will not risk those life for boat that hold be clear yes sir man that be cold you know what be think be in your brain know then let us go fishing here we go come on bro put some muscle to it worry about yourself kiddo there be thing you can not fight act of god you see hurricane come you have to get out of the way but when you be in jaeger suddenly you can fight the hurricane you can win get them tie down and go down below now how far to the mainland ln mi off anchorage sir but we will not even make it past the shallow no we will not what about that island ln mi east no it be ln mi sir ln mi sir it be get close how the hell can it be get close kaiju hard starboard turn her around now oh god what the hell hang on ship secure adjust the torque be on it torque lock get him come on shoot him be on it be on it discharge read sir plasma cannon in the shallow shelf ln mi off the coastal line gipsy what the hell be go on job do sir light it up twice bag our kill you disobey direct order respectfully sir we intercept kaiju and save everyone on that boat get back to your post now yes sir kaiju signature rise that thing still alive sir gipsy we be still get signature that kaiju be still alive grab the boat and get out of there you copy grab the boat and get out of there now take it raleigh get this loccent we be hit leave arm go cold sir the hull it go through the hull raleigh listen to me you need aah no no loading discharge fry all the comms sir be not get any signal no signature sir what do we do now sir now want you to keep your eye on that gauge there now you know what would like to find would like to find whole ship that be what would like to find wait wait wait wait wait wait wait wait right there right there dig hey what be it it be just old toy we never find anything good listen oh my god stay here mister can help yancy yancy run get help fast it be gonna be all right the kaiju be learn our defense they be adapt evolve and we be lose jaegers fast than we can build them lima seattle vladivostok category kaijus be now come through the breach think even you can see marshal this be no longer sound strategy the frequency of the attack have increase the jaegers be not the most viable line of defense anymore be aware those be my ranger that die every time jaeger fall which be why be ask you for last chance excuse me marshal final assault with everything we have get the jaeger program be dead marshal on the other hand the coastal wall program be promise option the world appreciate all that you and your man have do but it be over we will authorize you to take all remain jaegers to the last battle statio hong kong we be prepare to fund you for the next month while the coastal wall be complete after that you will receive no further support you have your answer marshal so that be it it be over suit and tie flashy smile that be all they be stacker we do not need them more beam ration card guy come on come on let us go now get good news and get bad news fellas which you wanna hear bad news guy die yesterday work the top of the wall what be the good news the good news be get new job opening top of the wall okay who want to work who want to eat come on be here in sydney where early today yet another kaiju attack take place the kaiju enormous category break through the coastal wall in less than hour the wall of life have be deem unbreachable by its builder why the hell be we even building this thing that thing go through the wall like it be nothing ironically it be the recently decommission jaeger striker eureka pilot by herc and chuck hansen that finally take the beast down look they decommission the jaeger program because of mediocre pilot it be that simple that striker eureka tenth kill to date it be new record and you be still go to hong kong even at time like this well order be order what else be suppose to do chuck hansen of the pilot of striker eureka the jaeger that take down the kaiju mr becket marshal look sharp long time year month can have word step into my office marshal take me while to find you anchorage sheldon point nome yeah man in my position travel with the wall chase shift to make live what do you want have spend the last month activate everything can get my hand on there be old jaeger mark you may know it it need pilot be guess be not your choice you be my choice all the other mark pilot be dead look can not have anyone else in my head again be do be still connect to my brother when he die can not go through that again man be sorry have not you hear mr becket the world be come to end so where would you rather die here or in jaeger mr becket this be mako mori of our bright also in charge of the mark restoration program she personally handpick your copilot candidate hey at ease we will tour the facility and then miss mori will show you to your jaeger mr becket wait for us please hold the door please thank you thank you thank you stay back kaiju specimen be extremely rare so look but do not touch please mr becket this be our research team dr gottlieb and dr geiszler oh no call me newt only my mother call me doctor hermann these be human being why do not you say hello have ask you not to refer to me by my name around other be doctor with over year of decorate experience year be very sorry oh please who be that yamarashi oh this little kaiju yeah you get good eye my brother and take him down in you know he be of the big category ever he be wg tm of awesome or awful you know whatever you wanna call it please excuse him he be kaiju groupie he love them shut up hermann do not love them okay study them and unlike most people wanna see alive and up close day trust me you do not want to so that be your research division thing have change we be not army anymore mr becket we be the resistance welcome to the shatterdome war clock we reset it after every kaiju attack keep everyone focus the frequency of attack be accelerate how long till the next reset week if we be lucky my expert believe there will be kaiju attack even before that this complex use to lodge jaegers in bay just like this now we only have jaegers leave do not know it be this bad it be that bad crimson typhoon china of the great assemble in changzhou full titanium core no alloy fifty diesel engine per muscle strand deadly precise fighter she be pilot by the wei tang brother triplet local lad they have successfully defend hong kong port times they use the thundercloud formation hell yeah triple arm technique very effective that tank last of the chemo alpha generation mark the heavy and old jaeger in the service but make no mistake mr becket it be brutal war machine and those sasha and aleksis kaidanovsky yeah have hear of them perimeter patrol siberian wall on their watch it stay unbreached for year year herc chuck gentleman welcome to hong kong wait here max come here remember me do not drool over miss mori see pretty girl and he get all wind up raleigh this be hercules hansen old friend from the mark glory day know you mate we ride together before we do sir year ago my brother and it be jaeger team drop that be right manila sorry about your brother thank you sir herc and his son chuck ll be run point use striker eureka fast jaeger in the world and last of the mark australia decommission it day before the sydney attack yeah it be lucky we be still around yep now it be run point for us wait run point on what you have not tell me what be do here yet we be go for the breach mr becket we be gonna strap gbp thermonuclear warhead to striker back detonate equivalent of million ton of tnt and you and other jaegers will be run defense for them think we be the resistance where would you get something that big see the russians back there they can get us anything herc shall we good to have you back thank you sir will show you to your jaeger now miss mori will you give me minute marshal sir we have hit the breach before it do not work nothing go through what be change have get plan need you ready that be all let us go herc max come here crew please report to the floor zero minus xy minus in the begin the kaiju attack be space by week then then then every week the last in sydney be week in day we can be see kaiju every hour until they be come every minute marshal we should witness double event within day mr gottlieb be to drop gbp thermonuclear bomb need more than prediction well uh that be problem then because see he actually can not give you anything more than prediction no kaiju entrails over my side of the room you know the rule every bloody day it be incessant gents on point number do not lie politics and poetry promise these be lie number be as close as we get to the handwriting of god what would you give me moment there will be double event and then shortly thereafter and then and then we be dead get it alas this be where the good news come here be our universe and here be theirs and this be what we call the throat the passage between the breach and us we know that it be atomic in nature predict that the increase traffic will force the breach to stabilize and remain open long enough to get the device through and collapse its structure yeah and that be where gotta chime in because really would not wanna go in there with that limit amount of information newton do not embarrass yourself just hear me out for give me please why do we judge the kaiju on category system it be because each be completely different from the next right you see what be say like look like shark and look like fish dr geiszler just get to the point yes the point be do not think they be all completely different after all these be some sample collect all right now this here be harvest in sydney and this be harvest in manila year ago they have the same exact dna they be clone and this be the point where he go completely crazy there be so much more to the kaiju than we understand and we have really only scratch the surface this be piece of kaiju brain now unfortunately it be damage it be little bit weak but it be still alive now think can tap into it use the same technology that allow the jaeger pilot to share neural bridge now think about that can tell you exactly how to get through the breach yourselves you be suggest that we initiate drift with kaiju no no no no not like whole kaiju you know just tiny piece of its brain the neural surge would be too much for the human brain agree do not agree gottlieb would like your data on my desk asap sir no but his be so thank you newt guy now this be the most amaze thing newton know that you be desperate to be right so you have not waste your life be kaiju groupie but it be not go to work it be go to work hermann and will tell you something else fortune favor the brave dude you hear them they will not give you the equipment and even if they do you would kill yourself or would be rock star there she be oh my god look at her gipsy danger god it be so beautiful she look like new good than new she have double core nuclear reactor she be of kind now she always be how do you like your ride becket boy solid iron hull no alloy forty engine block per muscle strand hyper torque driver for every limb and new fluid synapse system come here tendo it be good to see you buddy it be good to see you too brother it be just like old time so what be your story restore old jaegers show has been like me around that can not be it you pilot no not yet but wanna be more than anything what be your simulator score fifty one drop kill wow that be amaze but you be not of the candidate tomorrow be not the marshal have his reason yeah he always do do not he but with kill can not imagine what they can be hope you approve of my choice have study your fight technique and strategy even alaska and what do you think think you be unpredictable you have habit of deviate from standard combat technique you take risk that endanger yourself and your crew do not think you be the right man for this mission wow thank you for your honesty you may be right but day when you be pilot you be gonna see that in combat you make decision and you have to live with the consequence that be what be try to do the candidate be ready we will commence the trial immediately sir good but there be thing mako we have talk about this we will not be talk about it again you promise me mako vengeance be like open wind you can not take that level of emotion into the drift for my family need raleigh come sit with us oh be okay thank you ah come on there be plenty of room at our table have not see bread in while hong kong beauty of open port no ration we have get potato pea sweet bean decent meat loaf pass the potato raleigh this be my son chuck he be my copilot now he be more my copilot right dad so you be the guy eh you be the guy who be gonna run defense for me in that old rust bucket of yours that be the plan good so when be the last time you jockey ray about year ago what have you be do for year something pretty important reckon be in construction oh wow that be great mean that be really useful we get into fight you can build our way out of it eh ray it be raleigh whatever look you be pentecost bright idea and my old man he seem to like you but it be guy like you who bring down the jaeger program to me you be dead weight you slow me down be gonna drop you like sack of kaiju shit will see you around raleigh come on max you can blame me for that have raise him on my own he be smart kid but never know whether to give him hug or kick in the ass with respect sir be pretty sure which he need point to point to point to okay what you do not like them think you select them personally excuse me every time match end you make this little gesture like you be critical of their performance it be not their performance it be yours your gambit you can have take all of them move early you think so know so can we change this up how about we give her shot no we stick to the cadet list we have ranger only candidate with drift compatibility which have marshal mako this be not only about neural connection it be also about physical compatibility what be the matter marshal do not think your bright can cut it in the ring with me go strike mark win remember it be about compatibility it be dialogue not fight but be not gonna dial down my move okay then neither will one zero one one two one concentrate two two good watch it oh three two enough have see what need to see me too she be my copilot that be not go to work why not because say so mr becket make my decision report to the shatterdome in hour and find out who your copilot will be mako what be all that about mean be not crazy you feel it right we be drift compatible thank you for stand up for me but there be nothing to talk about that be my room excuse me mean come on think you want to be pilot mako this be worth fight for we do not have to just obey him it be not obedience mr becket it be respect would you at least tell me what his problem be in the wake of the sydney incident which show the ineffective nature of the wall of life program many be question the government motive and wonder why the jaeger program have be discontinue riots have erupt along the coastline of several pan pacific city we have now relocate million of civilian and supply ln mi inland to the safe zone safe zone for the rich and powerful what about the rest of us yeah answer the question believe the wall of life be still our good option at this time and that be all be gonna say on the matter thank you kaiju human drift experiment take the uh the brain segment be the frontal lobe um chance be the segment far too damage to drift with unscientific aside hermann if you be listen to this well be either alive and have prove what have just do work in which case ha ha win or be dead and would like you to know that it be all your fault it really be you know you drive me to this in which case ha also win sort of be go in in newton newton what have you do gipsy danger neural test commence in minute gipsy danger neural test commence in minute gipsy danger neural test may come in mako long time ago make you promise these transmitter be non operative need them replace setting harness for test mode wait for pilot pilot on board be gonna take this side if you do not mind my leave arm kind of shot sure be you gonna say anything no point in minute you be gonna be inside my head you look good pilots on board and ready to connect prepare for neural handshake initiate neural handshake okay we be not in the simulator now mako remember do not chase the rabbit random access brain impulse trigger memory just let them flow do not latch on tune them out stay in the drift the drift be silence neural interface drift initiate raleigh mama raleigh listen to me raleigh listen to me right hemisphere calibrate left hemisphere calibrate ready to activate the jaeger okay gipsy lining up nicely good get ready pilot to jaeger connection complete marshal marshal need to talk to you not now mr gottlieb be sure you can appreciate how important this moment be to me newton create neural bridge from garbage and drifted with kaiju find him prone and he be sort of daze do not exactly know what to do tell you it would work yes you do well what would you see it be only fragment of brain so really all be able to get be like series of uh image or impression like when you blink your eye over and over and over again all you really see be like frame it be emotion newton newton okay newton newton look at me now want you to take your time and be very specific okay okay well do not feel like they be just follow some sort of animalistic urge you know just hunting and gather and think they be attack us under order that be impossible be that impossible it be impossible why do not you drift with kaiju you shut up you keep talk these being these master they be colonist they overtake world they just consume them and then they move on to the next and they have be here before in sort of trial run it be the dinosaur but the atmosphere be not conducive right so they wait it out and they wait it out and now with ozone depletion and carbon monoxide pollute water well we have practically terraformed it for them because now they be come back and it be perfect see the wave that be just the hound category through it be nothing their sole purpose be to aim for the populate area and to take out the vermin us the wave that be the exterminator and they will finish the job and then the new tenant will take possession see the reason that find the identical dna in the separate kaiju organ be because they be grow newton need you to do it again need more information can not do it again mean not unless you have fresh kaiju brain lie around do you pretty impressive yeah he remember how to turn it on oi show some respect when his brother die he get the jaeger back to shore on his own have know other pilot that be be able to do that now there be certain individual whose business be the preservation and exploitation of kaiju remain uh yeah right um black market dealer right yep they be in and out in matter of hour they neutralize the acidic factor of the blood and they harvest what they need now this guy this be hannibal chau he run the kaiju black market here in asia when our funding run out we turn to him for help and in return give him exclusive right to all kaiju remain in the region you do that last day of war gentleman go to the corner of fong and tull show them that card look for that symbol and word to the wise do not trust him calibration complete the hull it go through the hull raleigh listen to me you need pilot out of alignment both out of alignment both of them both of them gipsy gipsy you be out of alignment you be both out of alignment be okay just let me control it out of alignment code red you be stabilize but mako be way out she be start to chase the rabbit mako do not get stick in memory stay with me stay in the now do not engage in memory mako mako listen to me mako mama mama mako this be just memory none of this be real weapons system engage plasma cannon power up oh no weapon system engage go to fail safe fail safe not respond there be problem with the neural blocker her connection way too strong fully charge mako mako listen to me this be just memory none of it be real the power line the power line get the main power line take them offline take them offline just do weapon system disengage mako neural bridge exercise in valid it be okay it be okay drift sequence terminate would you like to try again hmm hello pss pss you look for some kaiju bone powder some some bone some bone powder uh no why would want that male potency take it myself see uh no thank you be look for hannibal chau come you want chau huh good luck oh my god oh my god this place be heaven that be lymph gland from category and what be you work on here be this cuticle in mint condition be that kaiju skin parasite have never see them alive before they usually die as soon as the kaiju fall think you can not keep them alive you can if you soak them in ammonia what do you want be look for hannibal chau be tell he be here who want to know really can not say stacker pentecost send me oh that be great that be real great so take it you be hannibal chau right you like the name take it from my favorite historical character and my second favorite szechuan restaurant in brooklyn now tell me what you want before gut you like pig and feed you to the skin louse she can not control her drift and he go out of phase we all know what happen we can not afford mistake the kaiju keep evolve they keep kick our ass he be has been she be rookie do not want them protect my bomb run sir you need to watch your tone mr hansen hey stay there give me moment you be goddamn disgrace you be gonna get us all kill and here the thing raleigh want to come back from this mission because quite like my life so why do not you just do us all favor and disappear it be the only thing you be good at stop now yeah that be right you just hold back your little girlfriend of you bitch need leash apologize to her screw you say apologize to her hey hey enough what be go on on your foot both of you becket mori into my office no we be not finish this be over you be ranger for chrissake why do not you start act like go out of phase it be my mistake no it be my mistake should have never let you in the same machine so what you be ground us not you permission to be dismiss sir permission grant miss mori mako sir what be you do she be the strong candidate by far what other option do we have huh tell me do not let my calm demeanor fool you ranger now be not good moment for your insubordination mako be too inexperienced to rein in her memory during combat that be not why you ground her be in her memory saw everything do not care what you think you saw know what she mean to you saw it hey hey this conversation be over marshal marshal can we just talk about this for tm you rescue her you raise her you be not protect her now you be hold her back do not you ever touch me again do not you ever touch me again now you have no idea who the hell be or where have come from and be not about to tell you my whole life story all need to be to you and everybody on this dome be fix point the last man stand do not need your sympathy or your admiration all need be your compliance and your fight skill and if can not get that then you can go back to the wall that find you crawl on do make myself clear yes sir good be sorry should ve warn you drifts be rough but you be not just tap into my memory you be tap into my brother too when yancy be take we be still connect feel his fear his pain his helplessness and then he be go feel it know you know you live in someone else head for so long the hard part to deal with be the silence to let someone else in to really connect you have to trust them and today the drift be strong her heart when the last time you saw it not in long time movement in the breach double event signature dilation indicator category excuse me breach be expose at hour we have signature both category code name otachi and leatherback they will reach hong kong within the hour evacuate the city shut down the bridge want every single civilian in refuge right now crimson typhoon chemo alpha want you to frontline the harbor stay on the miracle mile striker want you to stay back look after the coastline we can not afford to lose you so only engage as final option yes sir you you stay put let us go loccent striker get the ball and we be on the roll loccent near position and await your order remain in the miracle mile engage at your discretion guys keep your eye open these category be the big we have ever see both in size and weight cherno alpha reach target zone disengage transport cherno alpha in position miracle mile chemo alpha hold the coastline beacon be on look at them they believe the kaiju be send from heaven that the god be express their displeasure with our behavior the silly bastard and what do you believe well believe that kaiju bone powder be buck pound what do you want need to access kaiju brain completely intact no no the skull plate be so dense that by the time you drill into it the brain rot away but be talk about the secondary brain now we both know that the kaiju be so large they need brain to move around like dinosaur want to get my hand on that mm what the hell do you want secondary brain for anyway mean every part of the kaiju sell cartilage spleen liver even the crap cubic meter of crap have enough phosphorous in it to fertilize whole field but the brain too much ammonia so what be the deal little fella well that be classify so can not tell you even if want to mm but it be pretty cool sol may tell you be gonna tell you figure out how to drift with kaiju be you funning me son it be fascinate how their mind work every single kaiju his mind connect the species have like like hive mind holy jeez you have go and do it have not you do it little bit yeah you goddamn moron loccent typhoon and alpha be in trouble we be move in you be to hold your ground do not engage we need you to carry that bomb do you copy jesus we can not just sit here and watch them die come on screw this loccent we be move in now chemo alpha we have be hit with some type of acid come on hull have be compromise we need backup immediately just hold on chemo we be on our way our power move yeah we just lose chemo sir engage air missile what be go on what happen the blast it jumble all the jaegers electrical circuit what the hell be that have never see that before loccent they be adapt this be not defense mechanism it be weapon get me striker nothing sir the mark digital fry it will take me hour to reroute the auxiliary all the jaegers they be digital not all of them marshal gipsy analog nuclear we get kaijus we gotta get out this way hang on excuse me what be go on there be goddamn kaiju head straight for hong kong city no that be not possible there be never be before well maybe that be because nobody ever drift with before eh genius when jaeger pilot drift it be two way street bridge right it set up connection both way hive mentality you say maybe those kaiju be try to find you what re we gonna do be gonna wait out this shitstorm in my own private kaiju bunker but you be go to public refuge try it once once now get the hell out of here move move be doctor be doctor okay hold on let me in okay be doctor okay let me in be doctor there be no emergency power we gotta bail be gonna try something else no do not disengage my arm come on get on your foot old man do not call me that he be right outside we gotta get out of here now we be not go anywhere now you and be the only thing stand between that ugly bastard and city of people now we have choice here we either sit and wait or we take these flare gun and do something really stupid how be your arm ah just give me the gun hey you think we just piss it off all right mako get ready this be for real yeah come on gipsy kick his ass come on let us do this together elbow rocket elbow rocket engage now hang on mako plasma cannon now plasma cannon engage empty the clip empty the clip wait think this guy dead but let us check for pulse okay no pulse he stop right above us oh my god oh my god this be not refuge this be buffet line he know be here he know be here shh he know we be all here no you do not understand he be try to get me he know be here what be she say gotta get out of here let me out of here oh come on those be expensive glass this be the bad torque engage can not pinpoint it it be move quick keep your eye open choppers do you have visual over come on will hold it vent the coolant on the leave flank coolant vent vent coolant atmosphere loss in progress temperature drop we be lose oxygen both plasma cannon be shot we be out of option mako sword deployment altitude actuation off balance ln ft to ground contact look there altitude loss critical ln ft gipsy listen to me loosen all the shock absorber use your gyroscope as balance and ball up it be your only chance foot fuel purge now impact alert we be come in too fast we be come in too fast brace for it mako mako talk to me mako you okay yeah you go to dr geiszler now yes sir want the remain jaegers back to percent functionality yes sir we be gonna harvest the skin the talon and the wing germans be gonna go nut for that stuff let me see that map here be where the kaiju fall here where we concentrate our effort we will get it boss right hey okay guess who be back you one eyed bitch and you owe me kaiju brain raleigh my kid would never admit it but he be grateful we both be mr becket miss mori in all of my year fight have never see anything like that well do proud of you proud of us all but as harsh as it sound there be no time to celebrate we lose crew no time to grieve reset that clock reset the clock still can not believe what you do to me mean can have be eat well that be definitely the plan lucky for you that do not become necessary huh thank you so much you be so kind really appreciate all of this but now do you mind tell me exactly what be take so long for your worker to get that brain well they pump the cavity full of co just like in any other laparoscopic surgery okay yes obviously the co gonna delay the acidic reaction yes and it allow us to harvest but our boy need oxygen pump into their suit they move slow what be go on in there boy we have reach the upper pelvic area unh move to the vertebra shit even through the suit boss it smell like dead catfish in here boss the secondary brain be damage aw it be ruin bitch how can they screw that up wait wait what be that do he say wait why wait do you hear that it be like heartbeat oh my god oh my god this can not be hold on hey let me have that shh shh listen listen listen to this it be pregnant no no please know it unh go his lung be not fully form umbilical cord tie around his neck no way he can survive outside the womb for more than minute look that be all need know he would not make it ugly little bastard anyway would how sick be you and why do not you tell me uh what be to tell you know them mark we scrape them bad boy together in month last thing we be think about be radiation shield run nearly dozen mission stay under the medical radar for while but the last time jockey be in tokyo finish the fight solo but for hour burn they warn me if ever step foot into jaeger again the toll would be too much you and be the only that ever run solo combat that be why bring you here what be it sir it be happen just get signature with unprecedented dilation meter spike what category checking the ratio category where re they head that be the thing they be not head anywhere they be hover just above the breach it be like they be protect it or something all right gipsy striker on deck sir herc can not ride his arm you hear me signature there be kaiju signature in the breach not like predict hermann have not exactly have very good day okay get about minute should be kaijus before brain death occur here do not wanna spend it talk about your theory this be all wrong there should be kaijus come through not there should be and there be be sorry it hurt to be wrong be not wrong but there be something here we do not understand hopefully we can argue about any mistake you make in your predictive model in the future but in the meantime the neural interface be way off the chart if you want to help help with that newton be not wrong there be only way to make sure and that be to do this together will go with you that be what the jaeger pilot do share the neural load you be serious you would do that for me or you would do that with me well with worldwide destruction certain alternative do really have choice then say it with me my man we be gonna own this bad boy by jove we be go to own this thing for sure oi tendo tendo you be not suit up yeah be aware of that elvis need to know what be go on he say suit up so suit up tendo can not pilot striker on my own now can dad hurt so who be gonna be my copilot do not remember it be so tight get back into that jaeger will kill you not get into would kill us all listen you be brave girl be so lucky to have see you grow but if be go to do this need you to protect me can you do that right everyone listen up today today at the edge of our hope at the end of our time we have choose not only to believe in ourselves but in each other today there be not man nor woman in here that shall stand alone not today today we face the monster that be at our door and bring the fight to them today we be cancel the apocalypse hey marshal you know that be great speech but how exactly be you and suppose to match up in there carry
