kelvin go for starfleet base starfleet base we have send you transmission do you receive kelvin have you double check those reading our gravitational sensor be go crazy here you should see this it look like lightning storm what you have send us do not seem possible yes ma am understand that be why we send it report it be still out of visual range give me tm alert captain robau that starfleet advise your ship to proceed with caution polarise the viewscreen can whatever this be be of klingon origin captain we have visual repeat can this be klingon negative lieutenant you be ln km from captain be you see this my god have read they have lock weapon on us red alert torpedo lock on us at degree mark arm weapon evasive pattern delta five incoming fast fire all phaser damage report warp drive be knock out never see anything like it weapon be off line main power they be firing another all power to forward shield lieutenant atmospheric stabilisation have be lose be our shield even up oxygen fail decks to we have confirm casualty sir shield and drop percent shield at we be drop here all remain power to forward shield prepare shuttle for evacuation hello my commander request the presence of your captain in order to negotiate cease fire you will come aboard our ship via shuttlecraft your refusal would be unwise walk with me if do not report in minute evacuate the crew sir we can issue there be no help for us out here use autopilot and get off this ship aye captain you be captain now mr kirk his heart rate elevate look at this ship be you familiar with this craft who be your commander be it him will speak for captain nero then ask captain nero what give him the right to attack federation vessel do you know the location of ambassador spock be unfamiliar with ambassador spock what be the current stardate stardate where be you from sir they be lock on our signal they be launch again bravo six manoeuvre fire full spread more out be initiate general order we be evacuate yes sir all deck this be the captain speak evacuate the ship immediately get to your designate shuttlecraft repeat evacuate that be george voice what be happen you will deliver in the shuttle go move this close let us go get him up be on my way george you be okay thank god have medical shuttle stand by get to it now can you do that yes everything gonna be okay do exactly as say shuttle george it be come our baby it be come now be on my way autopilot function have be destroy manual operation only manual operation only clear those deck now get to the shuttle move move move get to the hangar deck get to the hangar deck let us move it that be big just keep breathe you will be fine and the baby too right and the baby too right here go ahead and sit back captain to shuttle be my wife onboard yes sir she be need you to go now do you hear me we be wait on you sir no just go take off immediately that be order yes sir no wait we can not go yet please stop stop george the shuttle leave where be you sweetheart listen to me be not gonna be there no this be the only way you will survive be you still on the ship you have to be here the shuttle will never make it if do not fight them off george can not do this without you okay need you to push now what be it it be boy boy tell me about him he be beautiful george you should be here impact alert what be we gonna call him we can name him after your father tiberius you kid me no that be the bad let us name him after your dad let us call him jim jim okay jim it be sweetheart can you hear me hear you love you so much love

be the dimensionality dimensionality equal the logarithm and divide by non excludability and non rivalry four thirds pi time the radius cube when it be morally praiseworthy but not morally obligatory spock presume you have prepare new insult for today affirmative this be your thirty fifth attempt to elicit emotional response from me you be neither human nor vulcan and therefore have no place in this universe look he have human eye they look sad do not they perhaps emotional response require physical stimulus he be traitor you know your father for marry her that human whore they call you traitor emotion run deep within our race in many way more deeply than in human logic offer serenity human seldom experience the control of feeling so that they do not control you you suggest that should be completely vulcan and yet you marry human as ambassador to earth it be my duty to observe and understand human behaviour marry your mother be logical spock you be fully capable of decide your own destiny the question you face be which path will you choose this be something only you can decide spock come here let me see you no spock there be no need to be anxious you will do fine be hardly anxious mother and fine have variable definition fine be unacceptable okay may ask personal query anything should choose to complete the vulcan discipline of kolinahr and purge all emotion trust you will not feel it reflect judgement upon you spock as always whatever you choose to be you will have proud mother you have surpass the expectation of your instructor your final record be flawless with exception see that you have apply to starfleet as well it be logical to cultivate multiple option logical but unnecessary you be hereby accept to the vulcan science academy it be truly remarkable spock that you have achieve so much despite your disadvantage all rise if you would clarify minister to what disadvantage be you refer your human mother council minister must decline no vulcan have ever decline admission to this academy then as be half human your record remain untarnished spock you have make commitment to honour the vulcan way why do you come before this council today be it to satisfy your emotional need to rebel the only emotion wish to convey be gratitude thank you ministers for your consideration live long and prosper how be you hey hi hi hi would like klabnian fire tea budweiser classics cardassian sunrises and gotta try the slusho it be good the slusho mix thank you that be lot of drink for woman and shot of jack straight up make that her shot on me her shot on her thanks but no thanks do not you want to at least know my name before you completely reject me be fine without it you be fine without it it be jim jim kirk if you do not tell me your name be gonna have to make up it be uhura uhura no way that be the name be gonna make up for you uhura what just uhura they do not have last name in your world uhura be my last name well they do not have name in your world excuse me buddy so you be cadet you be study what be your focus xenolinguistics you have no idea what that mean the study of alien language morphology phonology syntax it mean you have get talented tongue be impress for moment there think you be just dumb hick who only have sex with farm animal well not only this townie be not bother you right beyond belief but it be nothing can not handle you can handle me that be invitation hey you good mind your manner relax cupcake it be joke hey farm boy maybe you can not count but there be of us and of you so get some more guy and then it will be even fight guy stop it stop it enough guy he be have enough outside all of you now yes sir he would not even listen just buy drink can you believe this it be not really fair come on you all right son you can whistle really loud you know that you know can not believe it when the bartender tell me who you be and who be captain pike your father son can get another for my dissertation be assign the kelvin something admire about your dad he do not believe in no win scenario he sure learn his lesson well it depend on how you define win you be here be not you thanks you know that instinct to leap without look that be his nature too and in my opinion it be something starfleet lose why be you talk to me man cause look up your file while you be drool on the floor your aptitude test be off the chart so what be it you like be the only genius level repeat offender in the midwest maybe love it so your dad die you can settle for less than ordinary life or do you feel like you be mean for something good something special enlist in starfleet enlist you guy must be way down on your recruit quota for the month if you be half the man your father be jim starfleet can use you you can be officer in year you can have your own ship in you understand what the federation be do not you it be important it be peacekeeping and humanitarian armada be we do be do riverside shipyard shuttle for new recruit leave tomorrow now your father be captain of starship for minute he save life include your mother and yours dare you to do good nice ride man it be yours year will do it in at ease gentleman never do get that name you need doctor tell you people do not need doctor damn it be doctor you need to get back to your seat have in the bathroom with no window you need to get back to your seat now suffer from aviaphobia it mean fear of die in something that fly sir for your own safety sit down or else will make you sit down fine thank you this be captain pike we have be clear for takeoff may throw up on you think these thing be pretty safe do not pander to me kid tiny crack in the hull and our blood boil in tm solar flare may crop up cook us in our seat and wait till you be sit pretty with case of andorian shingle see if you be still so relax when your eyeball be bleed space be disease and danger wrap in darkness and silence well hate to break this to you but starfleet operate in space yeah well get nowhere else to go the ex wife take the whole damn planet in the divorce all get leave be my bone jim kirk mccoy leonard mccoy captain nero you have be request on the bridge sir ayel say it be time sir we have arrive at the coordinate you calculate there be nothing here what be your order we wait we wait for the who allow our home to be destroy as we have be do for year and once we have kill him kill him be not gonna kill him be gonna make him watch capture that ship welcome back spock why be you so happy do not know what you be talk about no do not suppose you do hello lady be take the test again you gotta be kid yeah tomorrow morning and want you there you know have get good thing to do than watch you embarrass yourself for time be doctor jim be busy bone it do not bother you that no one ever pass the test jim it be the kobayashi maru no one pass the test and no one go back for second let alone third gotta study study my ass jim think love you that be so weird light light on do you just say that be so weird yeah do but you do not love me too oh my god my roommate but think you say she be go for the night obviously she be not quick get under the bed under look just get under the bed come on she can not see you here why not because promise her would stop bring guy back to the room really well how many guy have you just down just down hey hey how be you good the strange thing be in the long range sensor lab yeah think all night be track solar system and pick up emergency transmission really yeah from klingon prison planet no yeah klingon armada be destroy forty seven ship so you be not go back to the lab tonight gaila who be he who be who the mouth breather hide under your bed you can hear me breathe you big day tomorrow you be gonna fail get out gaila see you around if pass will you tell me your name no good night think the fact that you pick up transmission be very interest we be receive distress signal from the kobayashi maru the ship have lose power and be strand starfleet command have order us to rescue them starfleet command have order us to rescue them captain klingon vessel have enter the neutral zone and be lock weapon on us that be okay that be okay yeah do not worry about it do he say do not worry about it be he not take the simulation seriously more klingon warbirds decloaking and target our ship do not suppose this be problem either they be firing captain alert medical bay to prepare to receive all crew member from the damage ship and how do you expect us to rescue them when we be surround by klingons captain alert medical our ship be be hit shield at understand well should we do not know fire back no of course not what be this what be go on arm photon prepare to fire on the klingon warbirds yes sir jim their shield be still up be they no they be not fire on all enemy ship photon each should do let us not waste ammunition target lock and acquire on all warbirds fire all ship destroy captain begin rescue of the strand crew so we have manage to eliminate all enemy ship no one onboard be injure and the successful rescue of the kobayashi maru crew be underway how the hell do that kid beat your test do not know this session have be call to resolve trouble matter james kirk step forward cadet kirk evidence have be submit to this council suggest that you violate the ethical code of conduct pursuant to regulation of the starfleet code be there anything you care to say before we begin sir yes believe have the right to face my accuser directly step forward please this be commander spock he be of our most distinguish graduate he be programme the kobayashi maru exam for the last year commander cadet kirk you somehow manage to install and activate subroutine in the programming code thereby change the condition of the test your point be in academic vernacular you cheat let me ask you something think we all know the answer to the test itself be cheat be not it mean you programme it to be unwinnable your argument preclude the possibility of no win scenario do not believe in no win scenario then not only do you violate the rule you also fail to understand the principal lesson please enlighten me you of all people should know cadet kirk captain can not cheat death of all people your father lieutenant george kirk assume command of his vessel before be kill in action do he not do not think you like the fact that beat your test furthermore you have fail to divine the purpose of the test enlighten me again the purpose be to experience fear fear in the face of certain death to accept that fear and maintain control of oneself and crew this be quality expect in every starfleet captain excuse me sir we have receive distress call from vulcan with our primary fleet engage in the laurentian system hereby order all cadet to report to hangar immediately dismiss who be that pointy eared bastard do not know but like him fugeman regula gerace farragut mccoy enterprise mcgrath wolcott rader hood welcome to starfleet and godspeed he do not call my name commander sir you do not call my name kirk james kirk you be on academic suspension that mean you be ground until the academy board rule all right listen up be gonna read this list time and time only jim the board will rule in your favour most likely look jim gotta go yeah yeah you go be safe excuse me yeah yeah sure damn it come with me newton uhura farragut petrovsky antares go to your station and good luck bone where be we go you will see commander word yes lieutenant be not of your top student indeed you be and do not on multiple occasion demonstrate exceptional aural sensitivity and quote unparalleled ability to identify sonic anomaly in subspace transmission test consistently yes and while you be well aware that my unqualified desire be to serve on the enterprise be assign to the farragut it be attempt to avoid the appearance of favouritism no be assign to the enterprise yes believe you be thank you what be you do be do you favour can not just leave you there look all pathetic take seat be gonna give you vaccine against viral infection from melvaran mud flea what for to give you the symptom what be you talk about you be gonna start to lose vision in your leave eye yeah already have oh and you be gonna get really bad headache and flop sweat you call this favour yeah you owe me kirk james he be not clear for duty aboard the enterprise medical code state the treatment and transport of patient be to be determine at the discretion of his attend physician which be me so be take mr kirk aboard or would you like to explain to captain pike why the enterprise warp into crisis without of its senior medical officer as you be as you be come on may throw up on you jim you have get to look at this jim look what look we need to get you change do not feel right feel like be leak hell it be that pointy eared bastard mr spock captain engineering report ready for launch thank you lady and gentleman the maiden voyage of our new flagship deserve more pomp and circumstance than we can afford today her christen will just have to be our reward for safe return carry on all deck this be captain pike prepare for immediate departure helm thruster mooring retract captain dock control report ready thruster fire separate from spacedock the fleet clear spacedock captain all ship ready for warp set course for vulcan aye aye captain course lay in maximum warp punch it lieutenant where be helmsman mckenna he have lungworm sir he can not report to his post be hikaru sulu and you be pilot right very much so sir be not sure what be wrong here be the parking brake on no will figure it out be just have you disengage the external inertial dampener ready for warp sir let us punch it where be we medical bay this be not worth it little suffer good for the soul hi how be you come here my mouth be itchy be that normal well those symptom will not last long be go to give you mild sedative wish do not know you do not be such infant how long be it suppose to unbelievable engine at maximum warp captain russian whiz kid what be your name chanko cherpov ensign chekov pavel andreievich sir fine chekov pavel andreievich begin ship wide mission broadcast yes sir happy to ensign authorisation code nine five wictor wictor two authorisation not recognise ensign authorisation code nine five victor victor two may have your attention please at hour telemetry detect anomaly in the neutral zone what appear to be lightning storm in space soon after starfleet receive distress signal from the vulcan high command that their planet be experience seismic activity our mission be to assess the condition of vulcan and assist in evacuation if necessary we should be arrive at vulcan within minute thank you for your time lightning storm jim you be awake how do you feel good god man what what the hell this reaction to the vaccine damn it nurse chapel need cc of cortisone yes sir appear to be lightning storm in space appear to be lightning storm in space hey we gotta stop the ship jim be not kid we need to keep your heart rate down computer locate crew member uhura you know have not see reaction this severe since med school we be fly into trap damn it jim stand still stop it uhura uhura kirk what be you do here the transmission from the klingon prison planet what exactly oh my god what be wrong with your hand it be look who be responsible for the klingon attack what and be the ship be the ship what what be happen to my mouth you get numb tongue numb tongue can fix that be the ship what romulan what romulan romulan yeah yes yes damn it prod nero federation ship be on their way jim what be go on jim come back kirk captain captain pike sir jim come back here we have to stop the ship kirk how the hell do you get onboard the enterprise captain this man under the influence of severe reaction to vaccine bone please he be completely delusional and take full responsibility vulcan be not experience natural disaster it be be attack by romulans romulans cadet kirk think you have have enough attention for day mccoy take him back to medical we will have word late aye captain look sir that same anomaly that we saw today mr kirk be not clear to be aboard this vessel captain get it you be great arguer by regulations would love to do it again that make him stowaway can remove the cadet try it kirk this cadet be try to save the bridge by recommend full stop mid warp during rescue mission it be not rescue mission listen to me it be attack base on what fact that same anomaly lightning storm in space that we saw today also occur on the day of my birth before romulan ship attack the kelvin you know that sir read your dissertation that ship which have formidable and advance weaponry be never see or hear from again the kelvin attack take place on the edge of klingon space and at hour last night there be attack forty seven klingon warbirds destroy by romulans sir and it be report that the romulans be in ship massive ship and you know of this klingon attack how sir intercept and translate the message myself kirk report be accurate we be warp into trap sir the romulans be wait for us promise you that the cadet logic be sound and lieutenant uhura be unmatched in xenolinguistics we would be wise to accept her conclusion scan vulcan space check for any transmission in romulan sir be not sure can distinguish the romulan language from vulcan what about you do you speak romulan cadet uhura all dialect sir uhura relieve the lieutenant yes sir hannity hail the truman all the other ship be out of warp sir and have arrive at vulcan but we seem to have lose all contact sir pick up no romulan transmission or transmission of any kind in the area it be because they be be attack shield up red alert arrival at vulcan in tm emergency evasive on it sir damage report deflector shield be hold all station engineer olson report full reverse come about starboard degree drop us down underneath them sulu sir there be another federation ship destroy it too fire torpedo captain they be lock torpedo divert auxiliary power from port nacelle to forward shield sulu status report shield at their weapon be powerful sir we can not take another hit like that get me starfleet command captain the romulan ship have lower some kind of high energy pulse device into the vulcan atmosphere its signal appear to be block our communication and transporter ability all power to forward shield prepare to fire all weapon weapon ready wait the hull magnify yes sir captain we be be hail hello be captain christopher pike to whom be speak hi christopher be nero you have declare war against the federation withdraw will agree to arrange conference with romulan leadership at neutral location do not speak for the empire we stand apart as do your vulcan crew member be not that right spock pardon me do not believe that you and be acquaint no we be not not yet spock there be something would like you to see captain pike your transporter have be disable as you can see by the rest of your armada you have no choice you will man shuttle and come aboard the narada for negotiation that be all he will kill you you know that your survival be unlikely captain we gain nothing by diplomacy go over to that ship be mistake too agree you should rethink your strategy understand that need officer who have be train in advance hand to hand combat have training sir come with me kirk you too you be not suppose to be here anyway chekov you have the conn aye aye captain prepare the red matter yes sir without transporter we can not beam off the ship we can not assist vulcan we can not do our job mr kirk mr sulu engineer olson will space jump from the shuttle you will land on that machine they have lower into the atmosphere that be scramble our gear you will get inside you will disable it then you will beam back to the ship mr spock be leave you in command of the enterprise once we have transport capability and communication back up you will contact starfleet and report what the hell go on here and if all else fail fall back and rendezvous with the fleet in the laurentian system kirk be promote you to officer what captain please apologise the complexity of human prank escape me it be not prank spock and be not the captain you be let us go sir after we knock out that drill what happen to you well guess you will have to come and get me careful with the ship spock she be brand new dr puri report it be mccoy dr puri be on deck he be dead then you have just inherit his responsibility as chief medical officer yeah tell me something do not know shuttle you be clear forward shuttle enterprise you be clear forward interval check show positive and steady you get the charge right oh yeah can not wait to kick some romulan ass right yeah hell yeah shuttle command we advise you activate your shield now so what kind of combat training do you have fence pre jump shuttle commander you be clear from enterprise airspace gentleman we be approach the drop zone we have shot to land on that platform they may have defense so pull your chute as late as possible remember the enterprise will not be able to beam you back until you turn off that drill good luck away team be enter the atmosphere sir ln approach the platform at ln kirk to enterprise distance to target ln ln from the platform ln to target ln ln ln ln pull chute ln come on pull your chute olson no not yet not yet ln olson open your chute olson pull your chute ln no olson olson be go sir kirk have land sir give me your hand come on olson have the charge know what do we do this the jam signal go transport ability be re establish transporter control be reengaged sir chekov run gravitational sensor want to know what they be do to the planet aye commander captain sorry captain the drill be sabotage sir but we have reach the planet core launch the red matter kirk to enterprise they just launch something at the planet through the hole they just drill do you copy enterprise yes sir analyse data now transporter be now operational captain gravitational sensor be off the scale if my calculation be correct they be create singularity that will consume the planet they be create black hole at the centre of vulcan yes sir how long do the planet have minute sir minute alert vulcan command centre to signal planet wide evacuation all channel all frequency spock wait maintain standard orbit yes sir where be you go to evacuate the vulcan high council they be task with protect our cultural history my parent will be among them can not you beam them out it be impossible they will be in the katric ark must get them myself chekov you have the conn aye kirk to enterprise beam us out of here stand by lock on your signal retract the drill let us move out yes sir pull it up can not lock on to you do not move do not move kirk sulu sulu hold on get you now pull my chute kirk to enterprise we be fall without chute beam us up be try can not lock on to your signal beam us up you be move too fast beam us up can do that can do that take the conn aye sir the black hole expand we will not reach minimum safe distance if we do not leave immediately move move move move move can do that can do that move move move move quick give me manual control can lock on beam us up enterprise where be you hold on hold on hold on now now now do it now now now now now okay okay okay hold on hold on compensate gravitational pull and gotcha thanks no problem clear the pad be beam to the surface the surface of what what be you go down there be you nut spock you can not do that energise spock spock the planet have only second leave we must evacuate mother now spock to enterprise get us out now lock volume do not move stay right where you be transport in mother be lose her be lose her be lose her no lose her lose her act captain log stardate we have have no word from captain pike have therefore classify him hostage of the war criminal know as nero nero who have destroy my home planet and most of its inhabitant while the essence of our culture have be save in the elder who now reside upon this ship estimate no more than have survive be now member of endanger species be sorry be sorry be so sorry what do you need tell me tell me need everyone to continue perform admirably okay you must have lot of question for me only have for you need the subspace frequency of starfleet border protection grid specifically those surround earth christopher answer my question no you answer for the genocide you just commit against peaceful planet no prevent genocide in my time where come from this be simple mining vessel choose life of honest labour to provide for myself and the wife who be expect my child be off planet do my job while your federation do nothing and allow my people to burn while their planet break in half and spock he do not help us he betray us no you be confuse you have be misinform romulus have not be destroy it be out there right now you be blame the federation for something that have not happen it have happen watch it happen saw it happen do not tell me it do not happen and when lose her promise myself retribution and for year plan my revenge against the federation and forget what it be like to live normal life but do not forget the pain it be pain that every survive vulcan now share my purpose christopher be to not simply avoid the destruction of the home that love but to create romulus that exist free of the federation you see only then will she be truly save that be why will destroy all the remain federation planet start with yours then we have nothing leave to discuss you will give me the frequency to disable earth defense centaurian slug they latch on to your brain stem and release toxin that will force you to answer frequency please sir christopher pike captain enterprise as you wish have you confirm that nero be head for earth their trajectory suggest no other destination captain thank you lieutenant earth may be his next stop but we have to assume every federation planet target out of the chair well if the federation be target why do not they destroy us why would they why waste weapon we obviously be not threat that be not it he say he want me to see something the destruction of my home planet how the hell do they do that by the way mean where do the romulans get that kind of weaponry the engineering comprehension necessary to artificially create black hole may suggest answer such technology can theoretically be manipulate to create tunnel through space time damn it man be doctor not physicist be you actually suggest they be from the future if you eliminate the impossible whatever remain however improbable must be the truth how poetic then what would angry future romulan want with captain pike as captain he do know detail of starfleet defense what we need to do be catch up to that ship disable it take it over and get pike back we be technologically outmatch in every way we be technologically outmatch in every way rescue attempt would be illogical nero ship would have to drop out of warp for us to overtake them then what about assign engineering crew to try and boost our warp yield remain crew be repair radiation leak on the low deck okay all right and damage to subspace communication without which we can not contact starfleet there be get to be some way we must gather with the rest of starfleet to balance the term of the next engagement there will not be next engagement by the time we have gather it will be too late but you say he be from the future know what be gonna happen then the logical thing be to be unpredictable you be assume that nero know how event be predict to unfold the contrary nero very presence have alter the flow of history begin with the attack on the kelvin culminate in the event of today thereby create entire new chain of incident that can not be anticipate by either party alternate reality precisely whatever our life may have be if the time continuum be disrupt our destiny have change mr sulu plot course for the laurentian system warp factor spock do not do that run back to the rest of the fleet for confab be massive waste of time these be the order issue by captain pike when he leave the ship he also order us to go back and get him spock you be captain now you have to make be aware of my responsibility mr kirk every we waste nero get close to his next target that be correct and why be instruct you to accept the fact that alone be in command will not allow us to go backwards jim he be the captain away from the problem instead of hunting nero down security escort him out hey enough jim get him off this ship computer where be location delta vega class planet unsafe there be starfleet outpost ln km to the northwest remain in your pod until retrieve by starfleet authority you gotta be kid me stardate or whatever act captain spock have maroon me on delta vega in what believe to be violation of security protocol govern the treatment of prisoner aboard star james kirk excuse me how do you find me how do you know my name have be and always shall be your friend look do not know you be spock bullshit it be remarkably please to see you again old friend especially after the event of today sir appreciate what you do for me today but if you be spock you would know we be not friend at all you hate me you maroon me here for mutiny mutiny yes you be not the captain no no you be the captain pike be take hostage by nero what do you know about him he be particularly trouble romulan please allow me it will be easy what be you do our mind and together year from now star will explode and threaten to destroy the galaxy that be where be from jim the future star go supernova consume everything in its path promise the romulans that would save their planet we outfit our fast ship use red matter would create black hole which would absorb the explode star be en route when the unthinkable happen the supernova destroy romulus have little time have to extract the red matter and shoot it into the supernova as begin my return trip be intercept he call himself nero last of the romulan empire in my attempt to escape both of us be pull into the black hole nero go through he be the to arrive nero and his crew spend the next year await my arrival but what be year for nero be only second for me go through the black hole nero be wait for me he hold me responsible for the loss of his world he capture my vessel and spare my life for reason so that would know his pain he beam me here so that can observe his vengeance as he be helpless to save his planet would be helpless to save mine billion of life lose because of me jim because fail forgive me emotional transference be effect of the mind meld so you do feel yes go back in time you change all our life jim we must go there be starfleet outpost not far from here wait where you come from do know my father yes you often speak of him as be your inspiration for join starfleet he proudly live to see you become captain of the enterprise captain ship we must return you to as soon as possible ship we must return you to as soon as possible warp sir course mark laurentian system sir thank you gentleman you want to see me yes doctor be aware that james kirk be friend of yours recognise that support me as you do must have be difficult be that thank you be simply acknowledge your difficulty permission to speak freely sir welcome it do you okay then be you out of your vulcan mind be you make logical choice send kirk away probably but the right you know back home we get say if you be gonna ride in the kentucky derby you do not leave your prize stallion in the stable curious metaphor doctor as stallion must be break before it can reach its potential my god man you can at least act like it be hard decision intend to assist in the effort to re establish communication with starfleet however if crew morale be good serve by my roam the hall weep will gladly defer to your medical expertise excuse me green blooded hobgoblin hello what you realise how unacceptable this be fascinate what okay be sure you be just do your job but can you not have come wee bit soon month have be here live off starfleet protein nib and the promise of good meal and know exactly what be go on here okay punishment be not it ongoing for something that be clearly accident you be montgomery scott you know him aye that be me you be in the right place unless there be another hardworking equally starve starfleet officer around me get aff shut up you do not eat anything you can eat like bean and you be do be talk about food real food but you be here now so thank you where be it you be in fact the mr scott who postulate the theory of transwarp beam that be what be talk about how do you think wind up here have little debate with my instructor on the issue of relativistic physics and how it pertain to subspace travel he seem to think that the range of transport something like grapefruit be limit to about ln mi tell him that can not only beam grapefruit from planet to the adjacent planet in the same system which be easy by the way can do it with life form so test it on admiral archer prize beagle know that dog what happen to it will tell you when it reappear do not know do feel guilty about that what if tell you that your transwarp theory be correct that it be indeed possible to beam onto ship that be travel at warp speed think if that equation have be discover would have hear about it the reason you have not hear of it mr scott be because you have not discover it yet be you from the future yeah he be be not well that be brilliant do they still have sandwich there well she be wee bit dodgy shield emitter be totally banjaxed as well as few other thing on youse go so the enterprise have have its maiden voyage have it she be well endowed lady would like to get my hand on her ample nacelle if you will pardon the engineering parlance except the thing be even if believe you right where you be from what have do which do not by the way you be still talk about beam aboard the enterprise while she be travel fast than light without proper receive pad get off there it be not climb frame the notion of transwarp beam be like try to hit bullet with small bullet whilst wear blindfold ride horse what be that your equation for achieve transwarp beam get out of it imagine that it never occur to me to think of space as the

be with him he be with me we be travel at warp speed how do you manage to beam aboard this ship well you be the genius you figure it out as act captain of this vessel order you to answer the question well be not tell acting captain what do that do not frustrate you do it my lack of cooperation that do not make you angry be you member of starfleet yes can get towel please under penalty of court

ship undetected we can not just go in there gun blaze jim not with their technology be tell you the math do not support what you be suggest captain kirk captain kirk yes mr chekov what be it base on the narada course from vulcan have project that nero will travel past saturn like you say we need to stay invisible to nero or he will destroy us if mr scott can get us to warp factor and if we drop out of warp behind of saturn moon say titan the magnetic distortion from the planet ring will make us invisible to nero sensor from there as long as the drill be not actuate we can beam aboard the enemy ship aye that may work wait minute kid how old be you sir oh good he be doctor mr chekov be correct can confirm his telemetry if mr sulu be able to manoeuvre us into position can beam aboard nero ship steal back the black hole device and if possible bring back captain pike will not allow you to do that mr spock romulans and vulcans share common ancestry our cultural similarity will make it easy for me to access the ship computer to locate the device also my mother be human which make earth the only home have leave then be come with you would cite regulation but know you will simply ignore it see we be get to know each other prepare the drill all stop in give me one quarter impulse burst for tm will do the rest with thruster on my mark aye fire transporter room we be in position above titan really fine job mr sulu well do how be we scotty unbelievably sir the ship be in position whatever happen mr sulu if you think you have the tactical advantage you fire on that ship even if we be still onboard that be order yes sir otherwise we will contact the enterprise when we be ready to be beam back good luck will be back you good be will be monitoring your frequency thank you nyota so her name nyota have no comment on the matter okey dokey then if there be any common sense in the design of the enemy ship should be put you somewhere in the cargo bay should not be soul in sight energise captain we have starfleet officer aboard the ship of them be vulcan no ayel will cover you be you certain yeah get you do you know where it be the black hole device and captain pike move they have activate the drill communication and transport be inoperative sulu please tell me you have them otherwise we will not be able to beam them back kirk and spock be on their own now foresee complication the design of their ship be far more advance than have anticipate voice print and face recognition analysis enable welcome back ambassador spock wow that be weird computer what be your manufacturing origin stardate commission by the vulcan science academy it appear that you have be keep important information from me you be gonna be able to fly this thing right something tell me already have good luck jim the statistical likelihood that our plan will succeed be less than it will work in the event that do not return please tell lieutenant uhura spock it will work fascinate startup sequence initiate nero order your man to disable the drill or will know your face from earth history james kirk be consider to be great man he go on to captain the enterprise but that be another life life will deprive you of just like do your father captain nero the vulcan ship have be take the drill have be destroy spock spock open channel yes sir spock know should have kill you when

to ignore each other then why do you send kirk aboard when you alone can have explain the truth because you need each other can not deprive you of the revelation of all that you can accomplish together of friendship that will define you both in way you can not yet realise how do you persuade him to keep your secret he infer that universe ending paradox would ensue should he break his promise you lie imply gamble act of faith hope that you will repeat in the future in starfleet in the face of extinction it be only logical resign my starfleet commission and help rebuild our race and
