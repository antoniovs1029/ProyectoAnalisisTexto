for occult power and teutonic myth hitler use his fantasy to inspire his follower but for schmidt it be not fantasy for him it be real he have become convince that there be great power hide in the earth leave here by the god wait to be seize by superior man so when he hear about my formula and what it can do he can not resist schmidt must become that superior man do it make him strong yes but

those code have you that would be awkward schmidt will know this be lie he be go to kill you anyway doc you be liability you know more about schmidt than anyone and the last guy you cost us be captain rogers close friend so would not count on the very good of protection it be you or schmidt it be just the hand you have be deal schmidt believe he walk in the footstep of the god only the world itself will satisfy him you do realize that be nut do not you what the sanity of the plan be of no consequence and why be that because he can do it what be his target his target be everywhere tomorrow hydra will stand master of the world bear to victory on the wing of the valkyrie our enemy weapon will be powerless against us if they shoot down plane hundred more will rain fire upon them if they cut off head more shall take its place hail hydra hail hydra hail hydra hail hydra hail hydra hail hydra hail hydra blackout be still in effect throughout the london area please wait for the all clear your
