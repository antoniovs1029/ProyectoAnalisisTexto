leave the executive armoury bag in hand he set off that explosion to cover his track it can be week before the russians know it be miss unless we tell them they will not listen to us as far as the russians be concern we just bomb the kremlin the tension between the united states and russia have not be this high since the cuban missile crisis and the blame right or wrong point to imf the

the manifest enter your code pole jeez press enter retinal scanner retinal scan require watch out retinal scan require agent confirm ethan jeez think you be dead we be who be this agent dunn and carter william brandt chief analyst analyst agent confirm how will the world finally end it be my job to predict the unthinkable to treat the death of billion as game after year of this be numb until new question cross my mind what happen after the end of the world be you sure your line be secure every or year be you certain your line be secure some natural catastrophe devastate all life on earth but life go on and what little remain be make strong put simply world destruction be unpleasant but necessary part of evolution what happen then wonder when mankind face the next end of the world do not care what you have to do to get him to dubai will make it worth his while just do it look to hiroshima nagasaki will be wait for your call thrive city rebuild from the ash monument to the unimaginable dedicate to the concept of peace it occur to me here that nuclear war may have place in the natural order but only if it can be control only if it touch every live soul equally imf now believe this man kurt hendricks be the nuclear extremist code name cobalt today he be see leave the kremlin with what be likely nuclear launch device day ago sabine moreau kill of our agent in budapest and relieve him of russian nuclear launch code intel indicate she will check into the burj hotel in dubai in hour marius wistrom be know operative of cobalt wistrom be currently en route to dubai for the launch device to work cobalt need the activation code he be send wistrom to buy them from moreau the secretary be dead the president have invoke ghost protocol we be shut down no satellite safe house support or extraction the of us and the content of this car be all that remain of the imf and as of this moment any action be unsanctioned so if you want out speak now our mission be hendricks we be all that stand between him and his goal nothing can be leave to chance everyone connect with this man be consider asset with valuable information about our target no one can know we be still on line we lose hendricks now we lose him forever so what be the play wistrom will take delivery from moreau in hour now we can not let the launch code leave the hotel but we need wistrom to lead us to hendricks he will only do that if he have the code or if he think he have them our objective be to intercept the sale replace the authentic code with counterfeit and follow wistrom to hendricks well that be simple enough we snatch the code we gin up some fake jane you double moreau and sell the code to wistrom and bob your uncle and how do you propose we just snatch the code from moreau we take her out yeah we take her out but you know discreetly discreetly yeah right she be asset right get it sorry nothing leave to chance he say be spitballing it be not all gonna be gold we do not touch wistrom all right or moreau she will answer for hanaway but it have to be when say after we hit hendricks only pack what we need yeah absolutely only pack what we you never know so even if we can double wistrom and moreau how do we keep them in separate room while have them think that they be in the same room we give the hotel facelift wistrom will think he be arrive at moreau suite but really he will be walk into our decoy room where will double moreau downstairs benji will double wistrom mask and meet with the real moreau and what be do you you be the helper helper that be great okay so to the extent understand what you be talk about here the burj khalifa it be the tall building in the world and you want to alter its infrastructure with the hope of convince people that they have have meeting which actually really never happen right camel eta on dry clean on my way up okay minute to door knock wow okay this be slight wrinkle but nothing to worry about we be just go to have to go into the server room from the outside what well the firewall on this building server be military grade mean this would be cinch if can call youssef back at headquarters but youssef do not exist any more and neither do we can hack it but it would take too long then hardwire in and there be layer of next gen security between us and the server room there be no way we can get to it from inside if we can not get to the server we do not control the elevator we do not control the security camera this operation be over before it even begin be tell you we can get to it from outside we be be on the computer be just the helper what floor be it on vent duct pressure sensitive not enough time elevator shaft infrared sensor not enough time how be suppose to do this god damn it oh that be high okay now remember it be roll off motion that disengage the bond when the meter be blue that be full adhesion easy way to remember blue be glue and when it be red dead here your cutter okay and your server interface both go back here okay ethan the hotel server be eleven storey up and unit over okay comm check yeah copy so it be minute to door knock yeah minute to door knock what the hell be that yeah what the hell be that it be sandstorm it be long way off ethan should not be problem minute to door knock where be ethan you have get to be kid me minute to door knock be at server level minute to door knock the countdown be not help be just say be in that be great ethan you be halfway home located server please tell me we be online all right we be live okay now have control of the elevator and the security camera time to redecorate okay you drive and look out for wistrom and moreau moreau be at the elevator ahead of schedule go we can not open this door can we the door no ethan you gotta get down here now ethan is there problem ethan we be not gonna make it we have to make it where be ethan your line not long enough no shit that be not easy but do it what would miss the lens may be little uncomfortable it capture image and transmit them to the printer in the briefcase all right can not see out of eye but be fine blink twice to activate the shutter notice the number be in order perfect copy but the number be scramble mask tm you sure should not wear mask you know cause be not exactly omar sharif will play it french this be your track device this be what you be track the paper clip no it be the paper it be in the briefcase it be coat with isotope which give off unique it just mean that you can track the document even if they switch briefcase range not that good it be like half mile safe thing to do would be not let wistrom out of your sight be that wistrom who be that with him do not know we do not have uplink so there be no facial recognition who be that with him that be leonid lisenker polish born cryptographer he redesign russia nuclear security after the cold war he be here to authenticate the launch code yes he be we be blow no we be not blow well we will be as soon as he see the counterfeit launch code we be not blow he be in the elevator delay them benji how long would it take you to reprogram the case couple of second what for though to make exact copy of the launch code what you can not do that wistrom on slow him down will do what can wait wait ethan hang on now hang on just you be talk about hand over active nuclear launch code to wistrom yes reprogram the case listen stop just listen to what you be say you be fixate you be not think clearly it be not gonna happen will not let it and climb brandt use your head now the mission be not the code the mission be hendricks then just let it play out give him bad code neutralise him you know that will not do it failure to terrorist be just rehearsal for success we lose hendricks today he show up somewhere else tomorrow he find another way with no imf to stop him no it be now or never now brandt give me the case nothing can be leave to chance you say that you be the analyst now tell me there be not another way for hendricks to get those code you tell me that this be his only avenue right here right now today you tell me that will walk away we
