repair we have be try to put her back together since the late do not tell me you have have this for year and you do not know anything about them oh hell no no no we know ton about them but the neat stuff the neat stuff have only happen in the last few day see we can not duplicate their type of power so we have never be able to experiment but since these guy start show up all the little gizmos inside turn on the last hour have be really excite excite people be die out there do not think excite be the word would choose to describe it you guy be hope to fly this thing huh you say you can repair their technology can you tell us anything useful about them oh yeah yeah yeah yeah well mean they be not all that dissimilar from us breathe oxygen comparable tolerance to heat cold probably why they be interest in our planet hey hey you guy want to see them hmm this be this be the vault or as some of us have come to call it the freak show ha ha ha ha ha the when we find them they be wear some sort of biomechanical suit but once we get them off we learn great deal about their anatomy eye ear no vocal chord we be assume they communicate with each other through some other mean you be obviously not think about hand signal and body language it be some kind of extrasensory perception telepathy so it be organic life form can they be kill their body be just as frail as ours these die in the crash this few week late you just you have to get through their technology which be be sorry to say far more advance david you unlock part of that technology you crack the code oh no no all do

around them major more time anytime take deep breath how do you do that give it cold give it virus computer virus be you tell us you can send out signal that will disable all their shield that be right just like they use our satellite against us we can use their own signal against them if we plant virus into that mother ship it be gonna then filter down into all the correspond ship below be sorry do not understand just how exactly do we infect the mother ship with this virus well we be go to uh have to um ahem fly their alien craft out of our atmosphere and dock with it we can enter here as show in these satellite photo we then upload the virus we then set off some kind of explosion which will disable it and that will disorient the small ship below and that can buy think at least some time to uh to take em take em out take em down do your do your stuff this be ridiculous how long would their shield be down uh do not know matter of minute you want us to coordinate massive worldwide counterstrike with window of only few minute with the shield down that may be possible oh please we do not have the manpower or the resource to launch that kind of campaign not to mention that this whole cockamamie plan be dependent on machine that no one in this world be qualify to operate would not say that sir have see these thing in action and be well aware of their maneuvering capability with your permission general would like the opportunity to try that thing be wreck crash land back in the fifties we do not even know if it be capable of fly jim uh remove the clamp click any question

themselves for fear of annihilation what we be planning at this time be to launch counteroffensive however with our deplete manpower we be ask that anyone with any flight experience come forward military training be preferable but anyone who can fly plane would be useful can fly be pilot all right guy listen up mitchell all right pay close attention these be very different than the jet you have pilot before it be kind of strong you will have to forgive the expression but you be about to get crash course in modern avionics ugh keep it come keep it come ok you get it all right listen up

transmitter we can get it will tell us when you have upload the virus tm do not you think that be cut it little too close oh we be gonna be well on our way back home before we shoot that thing off why
