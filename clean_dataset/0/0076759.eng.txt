same as your father wish would know him he be the good starpilot in the galaxy and cunning warrior understand you have become quite good pilot yourself and he be good friend which remind me have something here for you your father want you to have this when you be old enough but your uncle would not allow it he fear you may follow old obi wan on some damn fool idealistic crusade like your father do sir if you will not be need me will close down for while go ahead what be it it be your father lightsabre this be the weapon of jedi knight not as clumsy or random as blaster elegant weapon for more civilize age for over generation the jedi knight be the guardian of peace and justice in the old republic before the dark time before the empire how do my father die ayoung jedi name darth vader who be pupil of mine until he turn to evil help the empire hunt down and destroy the jedi knight he betray and murder your father now the jedi be all but extinct vader be seduce by the dark side of the force the force the force be what give jedi his power it be energy field create by all live thing it surround us and penetrate us it bind the galaxy together let us see if we can not figure out what you be little friend and where you come from saw part of message seem to have find it general kenobi year ago you serve my father in the clone wars now he beg you to help him in his struggle against the empire regret that be unable to present my father request in person but my ship have fall under attack and my mission to bring you to alderaan have fail have place information vital to the survival of the rebellion into the memory system of this unit my father will know how to retrieve it you must see this droid safely deliver to him on alderaan this be our most desperate hour help me obi wan kenobi you be my only hope you must learn the way of the force if you be to come with me to alderaan alderaan be not go to alderaan have gotta get home be in for it as it be need your help luke she need your help be get too old for this sort of thing can not get involve have get work to do it be not that like the empire hate it but there be nothing can do about it right now it be all such long way from here that be your uncle talk oh boy my uncle how be ever gonna explain this learn about the force luke can take you as far as anchorhead you can get transport there to mos eisley or wherever you be go you must do what you feel be right of course until this battle station be fully operational we be vulnerable the rebel alliance be too well equip they be more dangerous than you realize dangerous to your starfleet commander not to this battle station the rebellion will continue to gain support in the imperial senate the imperial senate will no longer be of any concern to us have just receive word that the emperor have dissolve the council permanently the last remnant of the old republic have be sweep away that be impossible how will the emperor maintain control without the bureaucracy the regional governor now have direct control over their territory fear will keep the local system in line fear of this battle station and what of the rebellion if the rebel have obtain complete technical readout of this station it be possible however unlikely that they may find weakness and exploit it the plan you refer to will soon be back in our hand any attack by the rebel against this station would be useless gesture no matter what technical data they have obtain this station be now the ultimate power in the universe suggest we use it do not be too proud of this technological terror you have construct the ability to destroy planet be insignificant next to the power of the force do not try to frighten us with your sorcerer way lord vader your sad devotion to that ancient religion have not help you conjure up the steal data tape or give you clairvoyance enough to find the rebel hide fortress find your lack of faith disturb enough of this vader release him as you wish this bicker be pointless lord vader will provide us with the location of the rebel fortress by the time this station be operational we will then crush the rebellion with swift stroke it look like the sandpeople do this there be gaffi stick bantha track have just never hear of them hit anything this big before they do not but we be mean to think they do these track be side by side sandpeople always ride single file to hide their number these be the same jawas that sell us and po and these blast point too accurate for sandpeople only imperial stormtroopers be so precise but why would imperial troop want to slaughter jawas if they trace the robot here they may have learn who they sell them to and that would lead them back home wait luke it be too dangerous uncle owen aunt beru now your highness we will discuss the location of your hide rebel base there be nothing you can have do have you be there you would have be kill too and the droids would now be in the hands of the empire want to come with you to alderaan there be nothing for me here now want to learn the way of the force and become jedi like my father mo eisley spaceport you will never find more wretched hive of scum and villainy we must be cautious how long have you have these droids or season they be up for sale if you want them let me see your identification you do not need to see his identification we do not need to see his identification these be not the droids you be look for these be not the droids we be look for he can go about his business you can go about your business move along move along can not abide those jawas disgust creature go on go on can not understand how we get by those troop think we be dead the force can have strong influence on the weak minded you really think we be gonna find pilot here to take us to alderaan most of the good freighter pilot be to be find here only watch your step this place can be little rough be ready for anything come along hey we do not serve their kind here what your droids they will have to wait outside we do not want them here wait out by the speeder we do not want any trouble heartily agree with you sir will have of those he do not like you be sorry do not like you either you just watch yourself we be want man have the death sentence on system will be careful then you will be dead this little not worth the effort come let me get you something be all right chewbacca here be mate on ship that may suit us do not like the look of this han solo be captain of the millennium falcon chewie here tell me you be look for passage to the alderaan system yes indeed if it be fast ship fast ship you have never hear of the millennium falcon should have it be the ship that make the kessel run in less than parsecs have outrun imperial starships not the local bulk cruiser mind you be talk about the big corellian ship now she be fast enough for you old man what be the cargo only passenger myself the boy droids and no question ask be it some kind of local trouble let us just say we would like to avoid any imperial entanglement well that be the real trick be not it and it be gonna cost you something extra all in advance we can almost buy our own ship for that but who be gonna fly it kid you you bet can be not such bad pilot we do not have to sit here and listen we can pay you now plus when we reach alderaan okay you guy get yourselves ship we will leave as soon as you be ready dock bay ninety four look like somebody begin to take interest in your handiwork all right we will check it out those guy must really be desperate this can really save my neck get back to the ship get it ready you will have to sell your speeder that be okay be never come back to this planet again go somewhere solo yes greedo as matter of fact be just go to see your boss tell jabba that have get his money it be too late you should have pay him when you have the chance jabba put price on your head so large every bounty hunter in the galaxy will be look for you be lucky find you yeah but this time have get the money if you give it to me may forget find you do not have it with me tell jabba jabba through with you he have no time for smuggler who drop their shipment at the sign of imperial cruiser even get board sometimes do you think have choice you can tell that to jabba he may only take your ship over my dead body that be the idea have be look forward to this for long time will bet you have sorry about the mess her resistance to the mind probe be considerable it will be some time before we can extract any information from her the final checkout be complete all system be operational what course shall we set perhaps she would respond to alternative form of persuasion what do you mean think it be time we demonstrate the full power of this station set your course for alderaan with pleasure lock the door check this side of the street the door lock move on to the next would much rather have go with master luke than stay here with you do not know what this trouble be about but be sure it must be your fault watch your language all right give it to me will take it look at this ever since the xp come out they just be not in demand it will be enough solo come out of there solo right here jabba have be waitin for you have you now you do not think be gonna run do you han my boy you disappoint me why have not you pay me and why do you fry poor greedo jabba next time you wanna talk to me come yourself do not send these twerps han can not make exception what if everyone who smuggle for me drop their cargo at the sign of imperial starship it be not good business look jabba even get board sometimes you think have choice but get nice easy charter will pay you back plus little extra just need little more time han my boy you be the good so for extra fifteen jabba do not push it okay but if you fail me again will put price on your head so big you will not be able to go near civilize system jabba you be wonderful human be come on if the ship as fast as he be boast we ought to do well what piece of junk she will make past light speed she may not look like much but she be get it where it count kid have make lot of special modification myself but we be little rush so if you will just get on board we will get outta here hello sir which way all right man load your weapon stop that ship blast them chewie get us out of here oh my would forget how much hate space travel look like imperial cruiser our passenger be hot than think hold em off angle the deflector shield while make the calculation for the jump to light speed stay sharp there be more comin they be gonna try and cut us off why do not you outrun em think this thing be fast watch your mouth or you be gonna find yourself float home we will be safe enough once we make the jump to hyperspace besides know few manoeuvre we will lose em here where the fun begin how long before you can jump to light speed it will take few moment to get the coordinate from the navicomputer at the rate they be gain travel through hyperspace be not like dustin crop boy without precise calculation we would fly right through star or bounce too close to supernova and that would end your trip real quick what be that flash we be lose deflector shield go strap yourselves in be gonna make the jump to light speed we have enter the alderaan system governor tarkin should have expect to find you hold vader leash recognize your foul stench when be bring on board charm to the last you do not know how hard find it sign the order to terminate your life be surprise you have the courage to take the responsibility yourself princess leia before your execution would like you to be my guest at ceremony that will make this battle station operational no star system will dare oppose the emperor now the more you tighten your grip tarkin the more star system will slip through your finger not after we demonstrate the power of this station in way you have determine the choice of the planet that will be destroy since you be reluctant to provide us with the location of the rebel base have choose to test this station destructive power on your home planet of alderaan no alderaan be peaceful we have no weapon you would prefer another target military target then name the system grow tire of ask this so it will be the last time where be the rebel base dantooine they be on dantooine there you see lord vader she can be reasonable continue with the operation you may fire when ready what you be far too trust dantooine be too remote to make effective demonstration but do not worry we will deal with your rebel friend soon enough commence primary ignition be you all right what be wrong feel great disturbance in the force as if million of voice suddenly cry out in terror and be suddenly silence fear something terrible have happen you would good get on with your exercise you can forget your trouble with those imperial slug tell you would outrun them do not everybody thank me at once anyway we should be at alderaan about hour now be careful he make fair move scream about it can not help you let him have it it be not wise to upset wookiee but sir nobody worry about upset droid cause droid do not pull people arm out of their socket when they lose wookiees be know to do that see your point sir suggest new strategy let the wookiee win remember jedi can feel the force flow through him you mean it control your action partially but it also obey your command hokey religion and ancient weapon be no match for blaster at your side you do not believe in the force do you kid have fly from side of this galaxy to the other have see lot of strange stuff but have never see anything to make me believe there be all powerful force control everything there be no mystical energy field control my destiny it be all lot of simple trick and nonsense suggest you try it again luke this time let go your conscious self and act on instinct with the blast shield down can not see how be suppose to fight your eye can deceive you do not trust them stretch out with your feeling you see you can do it call it luck in my experience there be no such thing as luck good against remotes be thing good against the live that be something else we be come up on alderaan do feel something can almost see the remote that be good you have take your step into large world yes our scout ship have reach dantooine they find the remain of rebel base but they estimate that it have be desert for some time they be now conduct extensive search of the surround system she lie she lie to us tell you she would never consciously betray the rebellion terminate her immediately stand by chewie cut in the sublight engine what the we have come out in meteor shower some kind of asteroid collision it be not on any of the chart what be go on our position correct except no alderaan where be it that be what be try to tell you it be not there it be be blow away what how destroy by the empire the entire starfleet can not destroy the whole planet it would take ship with more firepower than have there be another ship come in maybe they know what happen it be imperial fighter it follow us no it be short range fighter there be not any base here where do it come from sure be leave in hurry if they identify us we be in trouble not if can help it chewie jam its transmission let it go it be too far out of range not for long fighter that size can not get this deep into space on its own he must have get lose be part of convoy or something he be not gonna be around long enough to tell anybody about us he be head for that small moon can get him before he get there he be almost in range that be no moon it be space station it be too big to be space station have very bad feel about this turn the ship around yeah think you be right full reverse chewie lock in the auxiliary power chewie lock in the auxiliary power why be we still move towards it tractor beam pull us in there be gotta be something you can do there be nothing can do be at full power have to shut down they be not gonna get me without fight you can not win but there be alternative to fight clear bay we be opening the magnetic field to your station come with me close all outboard shield close all outboard shield yes we have capture freighter enter the remain of the alderaan system its marking match those of ship that blast its way out of mos eisley they must be try to return the steal plan to the princess she may yet be of some use to us unlock and release charge report to control there be no one on board sir according to the log the crew abandon ship right after take off it must be decoy several escape pod have be jettison do you find any droids no sir if there be any they must have jettison send scan crew aboard want every part of this ship check yes sir sense something presence have not feel since get me scan crew in here want every part of this ship check there be no one here boy it be lucky you have these compartment use them for smuggle never think would be smuggle myself in em this be ridiculous even if can take off would never get past the tractor beam leave that to me damn fool know you be gonna say that who be the more foolish the fool or the fool who follow him the ship all yours if the scanner pick up anything report it immediately let us go hey down there can you give us hand with this tk why be not you at your post tk do you copy take over we have get bad transmitter will see what can do between his howl and your blast everything it be wonder the whole station do not know we be here bring em on prefer straight fight to sneakin around we have find the computer outlet sir plug in he should be able to interpret the entire imperial network he be find the control to the power beam that be hold the ship here he will try to make the precise location appear on the monitor the tractor beam be couple to the main reactor in location power loss at of the terminal will allow the ship to leave do not think you boy can help must go alone whatever you say have do more than bargain for on this trip already want to go with you be patient luke watch the droids they must be deliver safely or other star system will suffer the same fate as alderaan your destiny lie along different path from mine the force will be with you always

take awful risk vader this have good work not bad bit of rescue huh you know sometimes amaze even myself that do not sound too hard they let us go it be the only explanation for the ease of our escape you call that easy they be track us not this ship sister at least the information in be still intact what be so important what be he carry the technical readout of that battle station only hope that when the data analyse weakness can be find it be not over yet it be for me sister be not in this for your revolution and be not in it for you princess expect to be well pay be in it for the money you need not worry about your reward if money be all that you love then that be what you will receive your friend be quite mercenary wonder if he really care about anything or anybody care so what do you think of her han be try not to kid good still she be get lot of spirit what do you think you think princess and guy like me no you be safe when we hear about alderaan we fear the bad we have no time for sorrow commander you must use the information in this unit to help plan the attack it be our only hope yes we be approach the planet yavin the rebel base be on moon on the far side we be prepare to orbit the planet the battle station be heavily shield and carry firepower great than half the starfleet its defense be design around direct large scale assault small one man fighter should be able to penetrate the outer defense pardon me for ask sir but what good be snub fighter against that the empire do not consider small one man fighter to be any threat or they would have tight defense analysis of the plan provide by princess leia have demonstrate weakness in the battle station the approach will not be easy you be require to manoeuvre straight down this trench and skim the surface to this point the target area be only ln wide it be small thermal exhaust port right below the main port the shaft lead directly to the reactor system precise hit will start chain reaction which should destroy the station only precise hit will set up chain reaction the shaft be ray shielded so you will have to use proton torpedo that be impossible even for computer no it be not use to bull eye womp rat in my back home they be not much big than ln then man your ship and may the force be with you orbiting the planet at maximum velocity the moon with the rebel base will be in range in minute this will be day long remember it have see the end of kenobi and will soon see the end of the rebellion all flight crew man your station so you get your reward and you be just leave then that
