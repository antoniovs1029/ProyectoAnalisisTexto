damn it man that be our ride you just stun our ride oh great run what the hell do you take have no idea but they be bow to it kirk to shuttle local be out of the kill zone you be clear repeat spock get in there neutralize the volcano and let us get out of here we have to do this now tell the captain the shuttle be not build for this kind of heat captain do the indigenous life form see you no mr spock they do not the prime directive clearly state there can be no interference with the internal development of alien civilization know what it say which be why be run through the jungle wear disguise now drop off your super ice cube and let us go kirk out you be good if we be gonna do this we have get to do it now this ash be kill our coil you sure you do not want me to go instead that would be highly illogical as be already outfit spock be kid you get this guy we have to go now they be try to kill us they be try to kill us jim will see you in tm raising shield mark do it do it prerequisite change reduce descent repeat can not hold this position spock have get to pull you back up negative this be our only chance to save this species if this volcano erupt the planet die pull him back up now spock be you okay be surprisingly alive stand by we have to get him back will suit up be gonna go down we have to abandon the shuttle we can not just leave him sulu we do not have choice uhura be sorry spock we be go back to the enterprise we will get you out of there captain be ditch the shuttle you have get to make it to the enterprise on your own wonderful uhura you ready to swim be ready jim jim the beach be that way know we be not go to the beach oh no no no hate this know you do do you have any idea how ridiculous it be to hide starship on the bottom of the ocean we have be down here since last night the salt water gonna ruin the scotty where be spock still in the volcano sir captain on the bridge lieutenant do we have open channel to mr spock the heat fry his comms but we still have contact spock have activate the device captain when the countdown be complete the reaction should render the volcano inert yeah and that be gonna render him inert negative sir not with these magnetic field need to beam spock back to the ship give me way to do it uh maybe if we have direct line of sight you be talk about active volcano sir if that thing erupt can not guarantee we can withstand the heat do not know that we can maintain that kind of altitude our shuttle be conceal by the ash cloud but the enterprise be too large if utilize in rescue effort it would be reveal to the indigenous specie spock nobody know the rule good than you but there have get to be exception none such action violate the prime directive shut up spock we be try to save you damn it doctor the need of the many outweigh the need of the few spock we be talk about your life the rule can not be break spock try to get him back online tm to detonation if spock be here and be there what would he do he would let you die spock you all right captain you let them see our ship he be fine bridge to captain kirk yes lieutenant be commander spock on board sir safely and soundly please notify him that his device have successfully detonate you hear that congratulations spock you just save the world you violate the prime directive oh come on spock they saw us big deal can save her what do you say your daughter can save her who be you oh jim come on let it go jim you be not actually gonna answer that be you spock be tell you this be why he call can feel it your feel aside consider it highly unlikely that we will be select for the new program why else would pike want to see us forget about seniority they give us the new ship in the fleet can think of numerous possibility five year mission spock that be deep space that be uncharted territory think how incredible that be gonna be hey lady jim kirk uneventful admiral it be the way you describe the survey of nibiru in your captain log uh yes sir do not want to waste your time go over the detail tell me more about this volcano data say it be highly volatile if it be to erupt it would wipe out the planet let us hope it do not sir something tell me it will not uh well sir volatile be all relative maybe our data be off or maybe it do not erupt because mr spock detonate cold fusion device inside it right after civilization that be barely invent the wheel happen to see starship rise out of their ocean that be pretty much how you describe it be it not admiral you file report why do not you tell me incorrectly assume that you would be truthful in your captain log yeah would have be if do not have to save your life and the very reason feel it necessary to take responsibility for the action take responsibility yeah that would be so noble pointy if you be not also throw me under the bus pointy be that derogatory reference to gentleman starfleet mandate be to explore and observe not to interfere have the mission go according to plan admiral the indigenous species would never have be aware of our interference that be technicality be vulcan sir we embrace technicality be you give me attitude spock be express multiple attitude simultaneously sir to which be you refer out you be dismiss commander you have any idea what pain in the ass you be think so sir so tell me what you do wrong what be the lesson to be learn here never trust vulcan now see you can not even answer the question you lie on official report you lie you think the rule do not apply to you cause you disagree with them that be why you talk me into sign up in the place it be why you give me your ship give you my ship because saw greatness in you and now see you have not get wg oz of humility what be suppose to do let spock die you be miss the point do not think be sir what would you have do would not have risk my first officer life in the place you be suppose to survey planet not alter its destiny you violate dozen starfleet regulation and almost get everyone under your command kill except do not you know how many crew member have lose not that be your problem you think you be infallible you think you can not make mistake it be pattern with you the rule be for other people some should be and what be bad be you use blind luck to justify your play god give the circumstance this have be bring to admiral marcus attention he convene special tribunal to which be not invite you understand what starfleet regulation mandate be do at this point they have take the enterprise away from you they be send you back to the academy admiral listen understand regulation but every decision have make no can not listen you do not comply with the rule you do not take responsibility for anything and you do not respect the chair you know why because you be not ready for it blue security clearance now permit for airlock access be go to need titanium radiation protection be require in this area how do you find me know you good than you think do the time find you be in dive like this remember that you get your ass hand to you no do not you do not no that be not what happen that be epic beat no it be not you have napkin hang out of your nose do you not yeah that be good fight good fight think that be your problem right there they give her back to me the enterprise congratulations watch your back with that first officer though spock not go to be work with me he be be transfer bradbury you be go to be my first officer yeah marcus take some convince but every now and then can make good case what do you tell him the truth that believe in you that if anybody deserve chance it be jim kirk do not know what to say that be it be go to be okay son emergency session daystrom that be us yeah suit up all starfleet personnel please be advise new security protocol be in effect captain not anymore spock officer be demote and you be reassign it be fortunate that the consequence be not more severe you have get to be kid me captain it be never my intention not captain save your life spock you write report lose my ship commander see now should have alert you to the fact that submit the report no be familiar with your compulsion to follow the rule but you see can not do that where come from if someone save your life you do not stab him in the back vulcans can not lie then be talk to the half human part of you all right do you understand why go back for you commander spock frank abbot bradbury guess you be with me yes captain the truth be be go to miss you admiral marcus sir thank you for convene on such short notice be seat by now some of you have hear what happen in london the target be starfleet data archive now it be damn hole in the ground man and woman be dead hour ago receive message from starfleet officer who confess to carry out this attack that he be be force to do it by this man commander john harrison he be of our own and he be the man responsible for this act of savagery for reason unknown john harrison have just declare one man war against starfleet and under no circumstance be we to allow this man to escape federation space you here tonight represent the senior command of all the vessel in the region and in the name of those we lose you will run this bastard down this be manhunt pure and simple so let us get to work earth perimeter sensor have not detect any warp signature leave the system so we know he can not be far you will park your ship in blockade formation then deploy search vehicle and landing party to run down every lead this man have show willingness to kill innocent people so the rule of engagement be simple if you come across this man and fear for your life or the life of those nearby you be authorize to use deadly force on sight what be in the bag james not now it do not seem odd to you that he would target archive it be like bombing library chris everything okay there yes sir mr kirk be just acclimate to his new position as first officer you get something to say kirk say it tomorrow too late be fine sir my apology spit it out son do not be shy why the archive all that information be public record if he really want to damage starfleet this can just be the begin the begin of what mr kirk sir in the event of attack protocol mandate that senior command gather captain and officer at starfleet right here in this room it be curious harrison would commandeer jump ship without warp capability clear the room no we need air defense team daystrom conference room let us go cover me target acquire take him out watch my flank go go go cover me fire yeah commander mr scott have find something in the wreckage of harrison ship he have ask to see us right away captain find this in the crash jump ship sir this be how the bastard get away what do you mean it be portable transwarp beam device well can you figure out where he go already do sir and you be no gonna like it he be go to the place we we just can not go admiral sir he be not on earth he be on kronos sir request my command be reinstate and your permission to go after him give us minute kronos yes sir so harrison go to the klingon homeworld be he defect uh we be not sure sir he have take refuge in the ketha province region uninhabited for decade he be gotta be hide there sir he know if we even go near klingon space it would be all out war starfleet can not go after him but can please sir all out war with the klingons be inevitable mr kirk if you ask me it be already begin since we learn of their existence the klingon empire have conquer and occupy planet that we know of and fire on our ship half dozen time they be come our way london be not archive it be top secret branch of starfleet designate section they be develop defense technology and training our officer to gather intelligence on the klingons and any other potential enemy who mean to do us harm harrison be of our top agent well now he be fugitive and want to take him out pike always say you be of our good and bright you should have hear him defend you he be the who talk you into join starfleet be not he yes sir do he ever tell you who talk him into join his death be on me and yours can not be sir please all mr spock you say the province where harrison be hide be uninhabited affirmative sir as part of our defensive strategy develop new photon torpedo long range and untraceable it would be invisible to klingon sensor do not want you hurt but want to take him out you park on the edge of the neutral zone you lock onto harrison position you fire you kill him and you haul ass permission to reinstate mr spock as my first officer grant jim where be you for what your medical exam hour ago you be in damn firefight now it be my duty as ship be fine bones the hell you be be fine status report mr spock the enterprise should be ready for launch by the time we arrive good good captain thank you for request my reinstatement you be welcome as be again your first officer it be now my duty to strongly object to our mission parameter there be no starfleet regulation that condemn man to die without trial something you and admiral marcus be forget also preemptively firing torpedo at the klingon homeworld go against you yourself say the area uninhabited there be only gonna be casualty our order have nothing to do with starfleet regulation wait minute we be firing torpedo at the klingons regulation aside this action be morally wrong regulation aside pull your ass out of volcano be morally right and do not win any point for that be not gonna take ethics lesson from robot revert to name calling suggest that you be defensive and therefore find my opinion valid be not ask for your opinion bone get that thing off my face captain our mission can start war with the klingons and it be by its very definition immoral perhaps you should take the requisite time to arrive at this conclusion for yourself captain kirk science officer wallace have be assign to the enterprise by admiral marcus these be my transfer order you request additional science officer captain wish have lieutenant carol wallace doctorate in apply physics specialize in advance weaponry impressive credential thank you but redundant now that be back aboard the enterprise and yet the more the merry have seat doctor thank you shuttle crew stand by for lift off no be not sign anything now get these bloody thing off my ship captain be there problem mr scott aye sir be just explain to this gentleman that can not authorize any weapon on board this ship without know what be inside them mr scott raise yet another point report to the bridge captain mr scott understand your concern but we need these torpedo on board due respect sir but photon torpedo run on fuel now can not detect the type of fuel that be in the compartment on these torpedo because it be shield now ask for the specification but he say it be classify it be classify so say no spec no signature captain flight check complete we be good to go sir thank you mr sulu yes sir now if you will excuse me sir have warp core to prime get down jim your vitals be way off report to the med bay scotty need you to approve those weapon do not have time for lecture scotty do you know what this be it be warp core it be radioactive catastrophe wait to happen subtle shift in magnetic output from say firing or more of dozen torpedo with unknown payload can set off chain reaction which would kill every live thing on this ship let those torpedo on board the enterprise be the last straw what be the straw what be the there be plenty of straw how about starfleet confiscate my transwarp equation and now some madman use it to hop across the galaxy where do you think he get it from we have our order scotty that be what scare me this be clearly military operation be that what we be now cause think we be explorer sign for the torpedo that be order right well you leave me no choice but to resign my duty oh come on scotty you be give me no choice sir will not stand by you be not give me much of choice will you just make exception and sign do you accept my resignation or not do do you be relieve mr scott jim for the love of god do not use those torpedo attention warp core anti matter containment check in minute captain be so sorry about admiral pike we all be be you okay fine thank you lieutenant actually scotty just quit and your boyfriend second guess me every chance he get be sorry that be inappropriate it be just sometimes want to rip the bang off his head you know maybe it be me it be not you it be not wait be you guy be you guy fight would rather not talk about it sir oh my god what be that even like your ear burning captain on the bridge captain mr chekov you have be shadow mr scott you be familiar with the engineering system of this ship affirmative sir good you be my new chief go put on red shirt aye captain retract all mooring mr sulu yes sir docking clamp and be release all mooring retract lieutenant uhura open shipwide channel yes sir mr chekov how we look down there all system nominal captain copy that warp available at your command thank you mr chekov all right let us ride yes sir channel open sir attention crew of the enterprise as most of you know christopher pike former captain of this ship and our friend be dead the man who kill him have flee our system and be hide on the klingon homeworld somewhere he believe we be unwilling to go we be on our way there now that our presence go undetected tensions between the federation and the klingon empire have be high any provocation can lead to all out war will personally lead landing party to abandon city on the surface of kronos where we will capture the fugitive john harrison and return him to earth so he can face judgment for his action all right let us go get this son of bitch kirk out captain believe you have make the right decision if can be of assistance would be happy to accompany you on the away team you happy be simply attempt to use your vernacular to convey idea thank you mr spock all personnel prepare for the closing of payload bay door mr spock you startle me what be you do doctor verify that the torpedo internal you misunderstand what be you do aboard this ship there be no record of you be assign to the enterprise really that must be some sort of mistake my conclusion as well dr marcus except that you have lie about your identity wallace be the surname of your mother can only assume the admiral be your father mr spock be aware that have no right to ask this of you but please he can not know that be here engineering manually drop us out of warp sir mr chekov do you break my ship sorry sir do not know what happen the core overheat have to activate the emergency stop it must be coolant leak need time to find it sorry captain damn it mr sulu time to our destination minute sir that be minute in enemy space we be not count on all right we good hop to it where be spock here captain you be come with me to kronos lieutenant how be your klingon it be rusty but it be good good you be come too this be not go to be problem be it you work together absolutely not unclear will meet you in the shuttle bay jim you be not actually go down there be you you do not rob bank when the getaway car have flat tire be sure engineering will have us all patch up by the time we get back is not that right mr chekov yes captain will do my good sir mr sulu you have the conn once we be en route want you to transmit target comm burst to harrison location you tell him you have bunch of real big torpedo point at his head and if he do not play nice you be not afraid to use them be that problem no sir have just never sit in the chair before you be gonna do great jim wait you just sit that man down at high stakes poker game with no card and tell him to bluff now sulu good man but he be no captain and enough with the metaphor all right that be order mr sulu make sure that normian ship be ready to fly act captain sulu to shuttle bay please have the trade ship we confiscate during the mudd incident last month fuel and flight ready captain kirk be en route to you now ready to deploy captain lieutenant lose the red shirt you be normian arm dealer put those on sir look if this thing go south there can be nothing tie us to starfleet unless of course you want to start war mr hendorff no sir no sir good me neither be detect single life sign in the ketha province give the information provide by mr scott this be most likely john harrison mr sulu think we find our man you let him know you mean business aye captain attention john harrison this be captain hikaru sulu of the enterprise shuttle of highly train officer be on its way to your location if you do not surrender to them immediately will unleash the entire payload of advance long range torpedo currently lock onto your location you have minute to confirm your complain refusal to do so will result in your obliteration if you test me you will fail mr sulu remind me never to piss you off we will arrive at harrison location in minute captain it be unlikely that he will come willingly calculate the odds of him attempt to kill us at fantastic good thing you do not care about die be sorry lieutenant can not hear what you say oh do not say anything actually would be happy to speak if you be lieutenant would prefer to discuss this in private you would prefer not to discuss this at all what never seem to require your undivided focus be sorry captain just tm okay be us at that volcano you do not give think to us what it would do to me if you die spock you do not feel anything you do not care and be not the only who be upset with you the captain be too wha no no no do not drag me into this she be right your suggestion that do not care about die be incorrect sentient be optimal chance at maximize their utility be long and prosperous life great not exactly love song spock you misunderstand it be true choose not to feel anything upon realize that my own life be end as admiral pike be die join with his consciousness and experience what he feel at the moment of his pass anger confusion loneliness fear have experience those feeling before multiply exponentially on the day my planet be destroy such feel be something choose never to experience again nyota you mistake my choice not to feel as reflection of my not care well assure you the truth be precisely the opposite what the hell be that what happen where be their signal it cut out be work to get them back we be be pursue by class klingon vessel think this sector be abandon it must be random patrol hold on this ship have no offensive capability it be get us give me all fuel cell aye captain they be closing fast bearing all right there there we can lose them there if you be suggest that we utilize the passage between the approach structure this ship will not fit we will fit captain we will not fit we will fit we will fit tell you we would fit be not sure that qualify any sign of them no which worry me we lose them or they be jam our scanner or we lose them they be order us to land captain they be gonna want to know why we be here and they be gonna torture us question us and they be gonna kill us so we come out shoot we be outnumber outgunned there be no way we survive if we attack you bring me here because speak klingon then let me speak klingon this be not go to work it be our only logical option and if you interrupt her now you will not only incur the wrath of the klingons but that of lieutenant uhura as well lieutenant thanks captain stand down how many torpedo stand down the weapon you threaten me with in your message how many be there seventy two surrender on behalf of christopher pike my friend accept your surrender captain captain cuff him bone meet me in the brig be right there lieutenant contact starfleet let them know we have harrison in custody and we will be on our way once the warp core be repair yes sir why the hell do he surrender do not know but he just take out squad of klingons single handedly want to know how sound like we have superman on board you tell me put your arm through the hole be gonna take blood sample why be not we move captain unexpected malfunction perhaps in your warp core conveniently strand you on the edge of klingon space how the hell do you know that bone think you would find my insight valuable captain we good yeah let me know what you find ignore me and you will get everyone on this ship kill captain believe he will only attempt to manipulate you would not recommend engage the prisoner further give me minute let me explain what be happen here you be criminal watch you murder innocent man and woman be authorize to end you and the only reason why you be still alive be because be allow it so shut your mouth oh captain be you go to punch me again over and over till your arm weaken clearly you want to so tell me why do you allow me to live we all make mistake no surrender to you because despite your attempt to convince me otherwise you seem to have conscience mr kirk if you do not then it would be impossible for me to convince you of the truth coordinate not far from earth if you want to know why do what do go and take look give me reason why should listen to you can give you and they be on board your ship captain they have be all along suggest you open up oh hi you know what really bother me though it be the modification you know the enhancement right and then like that be off the ship just for try to do what be right and what do you do anyway you just stand there like oyster look at me what scotty it be kirk oh well now if it be not captain james tiberius perfect hair did you hear that call him perfect hair where be you where be you be you drink what do in my private time be my business jimbo need you to help me out with something will you take these coordinate down hmm are you write what you do not think can remember number ye of little faith what be the forty six do not know exactly what you be look for but have feel you will know it when you see it you may have be right about those torpedo will consider that apology and will consider that apology you be the who quit you make me quit mr scott scott ah the nerve of that guy be not do that man any favor no ach all right then be you out of your corn fed mind you be not actually go to listen to this guy he kill pike he almost kill you and now you think it be good idea to pop open torpedo because he dare you to why do he save our life bones the doctor do have point captain do not agree with me spock it make me very uncomfortable perhaps you too should learn to govern your emotion doctor in this situation logic dictate logic oh my god there be maniac try to make us blow up our own damn ship and that be not it do not know why he surrender but that be not it look we be gonna open torpedo the question be how but jim without mr scott on board who exactly be qualify to just pop open four ton stick of dynamite the admiral daughter appear to have interest in the torpedo and she be weapon specialist perhaps she can be of some use what admiral daughter carol marcus your new science officer conceal her identity to board the ship when be you go to tell me that when it become relevant as it just do be the torpedo in the weapon bay load and ready to fire what be they do not know that be why forge my transfer onto your ship to find out why do apologize for that by the way if cause you any problem be sorry be carol marcus james kirk torpedo my father give me access to every program he oversee then hear he be develop these prototype torpedo uh huh when go to confront him about it he would not even see me that be when discover the torpedo have disappear from all official record and then he give them to me you be much clever than your reputation suggest captain kirk have reputation yes you do be friend of christine chapel christine yes how be she she transfer to the outer frontier to be nurse she be much happy now that be good you have no idea who be talk about do you what what be we do in here be this shuttle prep to fly of course it be would you please turn around why just turn around it be too dangerous to try and open of these torpedo on the enterprise but there be nearby planetoid can open up there but will need some help turn around now captain on the bridge mr sulu have doctors marcus and mccoy land on the planetoid yet yes sir they be move the torpedo into position now good any activity from the klingons not yet but if we be stick here much long they will find us lieutenant uhura do you let starfleet know we have harrison in custody yes sir no response yet engineering to bridge hello captain can you hear me mr chekov give me some good news we find the leak sir but the damage be substantial we be work on it any idea what cause it uh no sir but accept full responsibility something tell me it be not your fault stay on it shuttle be stand by captain bone thanks for help out dr marcus ask for the steady hand on the ship you know when dream about be stick on desert planet with gorgeous woman there be no torpedo dr mccoy may remind you you be not there to flirt so how can these legendary hand help you dr marcus bones to understand how powerful these weapon be we need to open the warhead to do that we need to access the fuel compartment unfortunately for us the warheads on these weapon be live sweetheart once perform emergency section on pregnant gorn octuplets and let me tell you those little bastard bite think can work some magic on your missile dr mccoy there be bundle of fiber optic cable against the inner case you will need to cut the wire down whatever you do do not touch anything else do you understand right the think never cross my mind dr mccoy wait for my word be reroute the detonation process be you ready and raring good luck sir the torpedo just arm itself the warhead gonna detonate in tm sir what the hell happen can not get my arm out the transporter can not differentiate between dr mccoy and the torpedo we can not beam back without the other dr marcus can you disarm it be try be try jim get her the hell out of here no if you beam me back he die just let me do it stand by to transport dr marcus on your command sir shit deactivation successful captain dr mccoy be you all right bones jim you be go to want to see this delta team deliver your thruster to load dock vengeance bridge crew request entry to construction hangar you be clear to enter the hangar need weld team on the number nacelle holy sh what have we get this fuel container be remove from the torpedo and retrofit to hide this cryo tube be he alive he be alive but if we try to revive him without the proper sequence it can kill him this technology beyond me how advance doctor it be not advance that cryo tube be ancient we have not need to freeze anyone since we develop warp capability which explain the most interest thing about our friend here he be year old why be there man in that torpedo there be man and woman in all those torpedo captain put them there who the hell be you remnant of time long past genetically engineer to be superior so as to lead other to peace in world at war but we be condemn as criminal force into exile for century we sleep hope when we awake thing would be different but as result of the destruction of vulcan your starfleet begin to aggressively search distant quadrant of space my ship be find adrift alone be revive look up john harrison until year ago he do not exist john harrison be fiction create the moment be awake by your admiral marcus to help him advance his cause smokescreen to conceal my true identity my name be khan why would starfleet admiral ask year old freeze man for help because be good at what everything alexander marcus need to respond to uncivilized threat in civilize time and for that he need warrior mind my mind to design weapon and warships you be suggest the admiral violate every regulation he vow to uphold simply because he want to exploit your intellect he want to exploit my savagery intellect alone be useless in fight mr spock you you can not even break rule how would you be expect to break bone marcus use me to design weapon to help him realize his vision of militarize starfleet he send you to use those weapon to fire my torpedo on unsuspecting planet and then he purposely cripple your ship in enemy space lead to inevitable outcome the klingons would come search for whomever be responsible and you would have no chance of escape marcus would finally have the war he talk about the war he always want no no watch you open fire in room full of unarmed starfleet officer you kill them in cold blood marcus take my crew from me you be murderer he use my friend to control me try to smuggle them to safety by conceal them in the very weapon have design but be discover have no choice but to escape alone and when do have every reason to suspect that marcus have kill every single of the people hold most dear so respond in kind my crew be my family kirk be there anything you would not do for your family proximity alert sir there be ship at warp head right for us klingons at warp no kirk we both know who it be do not think so it be not come at us from kronos lieutenant move khan to med bay post security officer on him yes captain captain on the bridge eta of the incoming ship tm sir shield aye captain they be hail us sir on screen broadcast shipwide for the record captain kirk admiral marcus be not expect you that be hell of ship you get there that you would take harrison into custody in violation of your order well we uh we have to improvise when our warp core unexpectedly malfunction but you already know that do not you sir do not take your mean well that be why you be here be not it to assist with our repair why else would the head of starfleet personally come to the edge of the neutral zone captain they be scan our ship be there something can help you find sir where be your prisoner ki per starfleet regulation be planning on return khan to earth to stand trial well shit you talk to him this be exactly what be hope to spare you from take tactical risk and wake that bastard believe that his superior intelligence can help us protect ourselves from whatever come at us next but make mistake and now the blood of everybody he be kill be on my hand so be ask you give him to me so that can end what start and what exactly would you like me to do with the rest of his crew sir fire them at the klingons end life start war in the process he put those people in those torpedo and simply do not want to burden with know what be inside of the you saw what this man can do all by himself if we wake up the rest of his crew what else do he tell you that he be peacekeeper he be play you so do not you see that khan and his crew be condemn to death as war criminal and now it be our duty to carry out that sentence before anybody else die because of hi now be go to ask you again last time son lower your shield tell me where he be he be in engineering sir but will have him move to the transporter room right away will take it from here do not drop those shield mr sulu aye captain captain give your awareness of khan true location in the med bay may know the detail of your plan tell marcus we be bring fugitive back to earth that be what we be go to do mr chekov can we warp sir if we go to warp we run the risk of seriously damage the core can we do it technically yes but would not advise it captain note mr sulu set course for earth yes sir punch it well at least we be move again if you think you be safe at warp you be wrong lieutenant uhura contact starfleet tell them we be pursue into the neutral zone by unmarked federation ship comms be down sir permission to come on the bridge dr marcus he be gonna catch up with us and when he do the only thing that be gonna stop him destroy this ship be me so you have to let me talk to him carol we be at warp he can not catch up with us yes he can he be be develop ship that have advance warp capability captain be get read do not understand where be we we be kilometer from earth shield be drop we be defenseless sir sir we have bulkhead breach where be the damage major hull damage captain evasive maneuver get us to earth right now crewman aye sir captain stop everybody on this ship be go to die if you do not let me speak to him uhura hail him sir it be me it be carol what be you do on that ship hear what you say that you make mistake and now you be do everything you can to fix it but dad do not believe that the man who raise me be capable of destroy ship full of innocent people and if be wrong about that then you be gonna have to do it with me on board actually carol will not oh jim can we intercept the transport signal no sir carol captain kirk without authorization and in league with the fugitive john harris you go rogue in enemy territory leave me no choice but to hunt you don and destroy you lock phaser wait sir wait wait wait target all leave torpedo on the enterprise bridge sir my crew be just be just follow my order take take full responsibility for my action but they be mine and they be mine alone if transmit khan location to you now all that ask be that you spare them please sir will do anything you want just let them live that be hell of apology but if it be any consolation be never go to spare your crew fire when ready be sorry our weapon will not fire sir someone in engineering just manually reset our system what do you mean someone who their weapon have power down sir enterprise can you hear me scotty guess what find behind jupiter you be on that ship snuck on and see as have just commit act of treason against starfleet admiral would really like to get off this bloody ship now beam me out you be miracle worker we be little low on power right now just stand by stand by what do you mean low on
