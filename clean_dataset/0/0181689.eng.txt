question but watch him if there be any problem make sure we know about it when the pre cogs declare killer their name be embed in the wood since the shape and grain of each piece be unique they be impossible to forge you understand the legalistic drawback to precrime methodology here we go again be not with the aclu on this but we arrest individual who have break no law they will the commission be metaphysics the pre cogs see the future and they be never wrong but it be not the future if you stop it be not that fundamental paradox yes you be talk about predetermination which happen all the time why would you catch that it be gonna fall you be certain but it do not fall you catch it prevent it do not change the fact that it be go to happen you ever get any false positive someone intend to kill but do not how do the pre cogs tell the difference they do not see what you intend to do only what you will do why can not they see rape assault suicide because of the nature of murder nothing more destructive to the metaphysical fabric that bind us than the untimely murder of human that be not walt whitman iris hineman she develop pre cogs design the system and the interface speak of

and then you will be totally bugger all of it okay now take minute to right yourself just what be it you think can do for you you can tell me how someone can fake prevision how would know that because you invent precrime what be so funny if the consequence of several genetic mistake and science go haywire can be call invention then invent precrime you do not seem proud be not be try to heal them not turn them into something else heal who the innocent we use to stop the guilty you be talk about the pre cogs you think they come from test tube they be merely the one who survive be do genetic research treat child of drug addict this be year ago when neuroin hit the street it be impure not the engineer cocktail popular among the educate all of these kid be bear with severe brain damage most die before age those few who survive they have gift call it gift for them it be more like cosmic joke they would wake up in the night curl in the corner scream claw at the wall because when these child close their eye at night they dream only of murder over and over after the other it do not take for us long to realize that the real nightmare be that these dream be about to come true these murder be happen you say some of the child die so many of them despite what we do for them or maybe because of what we do to them but it do not matter it be perfect system now be not it be not go to commit murder have never meet the man be suppose to kill and yet chain of event have start that will lead you to his murder not if stay away from him can you avoid man you have never meet you will not help can not help you nobody can the pre cogs be never wrong but occasionally they do disagree what most of the time all pre cogs will see event in the same way but once in while of them will see thing differently than the other jesus christ why do not know about this because these minority reports be destroy the instant they occur why for precrime to function there can not be any suggestion of fallibility who want justice system that instill doubt it may be reasonable but it be still doubt be you say have haloed innocent people be say that every so often those accuse of precrime just may have alternate future do burgess know about this about this minority report use to joke with lamar that we be the parent of precrime parent often see their child as they want them to be and not as they be answer my question do lamar burgess know about the minority report yes of course he know but at the time we feel their existence be insignificant variable insignificant to you maybe but what about those people that put away with alternate future my god if the country know the system would collapse believe in that system do you really you wanna bring it down you will bring it down if you manage to kill your victim that will be the most spectacular public display of how precrime do not work be not gonna kill anybody hold that think why should trust you you should not trust anyone certainly not the attorney general who want it all for himself and not the young federal agent who want your job not even the old man who just want to hang on to what he create do not trust anyone just find the minority report you say the minority report be destroy the record be destroy the original report still exist design it so the report be store in safe place but not declare what safe place be that the safe place there be where be it inside the pre cog who predict it all you have to do be download it darling that be all huh just walk into precrime get into the temple somehow tap into these pre cogs and download this minority report if you have and then walk out actually you will have to run out but yes that be what you have to do you be insane or you think be will get eye scanned dozen time before get within ln mi of precrime sometimes in order to see the light you have to risk the dark as policeman excuse me as former policeman be sure that you know all sort of people who can help you out in this regard it be funny how all live organism be alike when the chip be down when the pressure be on every creature on the face of the earth be interest in thing and thing only its own survival find the minority report how do even know which have it it be always in the more gift of the which be that the female we have get man in room the victim be here john be here and this unidentified male at the window the adjacent building suggest public housing which mean there be thousand like this they be everywhere but he do not go there to kill crow for another hour this be chief anderton space he be not here he will be back doubt that be bet he be somewhere in the sprawl he be smart enough to go where billboard can not id him there be fewer consumer which mean fewer
