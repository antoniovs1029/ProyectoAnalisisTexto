be not fight army you have to think of this as single organism now these common drone they act like its claw and alphas like the that you kill be much more rare yeah they be like in million by my guess yes they act as the enemy they be like its central nervous system but this be the brain it control them all and this be the omega and the omega have the ability to control time whenever alpha be kill automatic response be trigger the omega start the day over again but you see this time it can remember what be go to happen just like you do it know exactly what we be gonna do before we be gonna do it and enemy that know the future can not lose it can not lose but if that be true how do you win at verdun we be allow to win this thing want us to believe we can win it want us to throw everything we have into the invasion operation downfall be not our endgame it be the enemy the thing you have get to understand be this be perfectly evolve world conquering organism for all we know there be million of those asteroid float around in the cosmos like virus they be just wait to crash land into world with just the right condition all they need be for the dominant life form to attack and there will be nothing to stop the mimic from conquer the rest of the world unless you change the outcome me when you kill that alpha you inadvertently enter the enemy nervous system cage you have seize control of the omega ability to reset the day how be that even possible perhaps this organism only vulnerability its only vulnerability be humanity regardless of that you control the power now just as do in verdun so be reset the day okay how do control it you have to die every day until the omega destroy of all this be terrific presentation terrific know the general we should take this to
