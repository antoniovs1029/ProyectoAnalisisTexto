you guy ever go to school well oh look the hebrews take the break piece and put them in the ark when they settle in canaan they put the ark in place call the temple of solomon in jerusalem where it stay for many year until all of sudden whoosh it be go where well nobody know where or when however egyptian pharaoh shishak yes invade the city of jerusalem right about bc and he may have take the ark back to the city of tanis and hide it in secret chamber call the well of souls secret chamber however about year after the pharaoh would return to egypt the city of tanis be consume by the desert
