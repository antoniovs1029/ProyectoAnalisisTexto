the future dark desolate world world of war suffer loss on both side mutants and the human who dare to help them fighting enemy we can not defeat are we destine down this path destined to destroy ourselves like so many species before us or can we evolve fast enough to change ourselves change our fate is the future truly set they be here time up sentinel sunspot let us go run go blink no too

body wow this may just work charles what may work the sentinel program be originally conceive by doctor bolivar trask in the early he be of the world lead weapon designer but covertly he have begin experiment on mutant use their gift to fuel his own research this be extraordinary there be mutant who have discover what he be do mutant with the ability to transform herself into anyone mystique know her as raven we meet when we be child grow up together she be like sister to me try to help her but only succeed in drive her away she hunt trask across the world and at the paris peace accords in after the vietnam war she find trask and kill him it be the time she kill it be not her last but kill trask do not have the outcome she expect it only persuade the government of the need for his program they capture her that day torture her experiment on her in her dna they discover the secret to her power of transformation it give them the key they need to create weapon that can adapt to any mutant power and in less than year the machine that have destroy so many of our kind be create but it all start that day in the day she kill the day she truly become mystique you want to go back there if can get to her stop the assassination keep her out of their hand then we can stop the sentinels from ever be bear and end this war before it ever begin uh can send someone back couple week maybe
