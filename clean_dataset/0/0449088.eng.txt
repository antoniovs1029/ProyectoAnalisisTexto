friend who want to see you be not certain can survive any more visit from old friend here be your chance to find out curious your friend appear to be quite desperate jack perhaps they no longer believe that gather of squabbling pirate can defeat the flying dutchman and so despair lead to betrayal but you and be no stranger to betrayal be we it be not here jack what what be not the heart of davy jones be safely aboard the dutchman and so unavailable for use as leverage to satisfy your debt to the good captain by my reckoning that account have be settle by your death and yet here you be close your eye and pretend it be all bad dream that be how get by and if davy jones be to learn of your survival ship ho be on your guard man my man be crew enough company ship company crew you agree the black pearl be to be mine and so it be perhaps you will consider alternative arrangement which require absolutely nothing from you but information regard the brethren court no doubt in exchange for fair compensation square my debt with jones guarantee my freedom of course it be just good business be in divulgatory mood what then may divulge everything where be they meeting who be the pirate lord what be the purpose of the piece of beckett agree the black pearl be to be mine lord beckett not gonna give up the only ship that can outrun the dutchman be he shame they be not bind to honour the code of the brethren be not it because honour hard thing to come by nowadays there be no honour to remain with the lose side leave it for the win side that be just good business the lose side you say they have the dutchman now the pearl and what do the brethren have we have calypso calypso old legend no the goddess herself bind in human form imagine all the power of sea bring to bear against our enemy intend to release her but for that need the brethren court all the court you can keep barbossa the belligerent homunculus and his friend with the wooden eye both and turner especially turner

you get us into this if this free us then do damn although if kill you then can use the compass to find shipwreck cove be it on my own cut out the middleman as it be elizabeth they be pirate have have more than enough experience deal with pirate then we have accord with me kill you would arrive at the cove find it stronghold nigh impregnable able to withstand blockade for year and then you would be wish oh if only there be someone have not kill inside to ensure that the pirate then come outside and you can accomplish all this can you you may kill me but you may never insult me who be be captain jack sparrow do you be mad thank goodness for that because if be not this would probably never work and that be without even single drop of rum send this pestilent traitorous cow hearted yeasty codpiece to the brig which ship do we follow signal the dutchman to track down sao feng we follow the pearl how soon can we have the ship ready to pursue she be come down do you think he plan it all

to decide caution barbossa do not forget it be by my power you return from the dead or what it mean if you fail me do not you forget why you have to bring me back why can not leave jack to his well deserved fate it take pirate lord to bind you calypso and it will take no less than to set you free master pintel ragetti take this fishwife to the brig right this way mrs fish can not be summon like some mongrel pup apparently you can believe you know each other come to join my crew again master turner not yours his jack sparrow send his regard sparrow you do not tell him we rescue jack from the locker along with the black pearl what else have you not tell me there be issue far more troublesome believe you be familiar with person call calypso not person heathen god who delight in curse man with their wild dream and then reveal them to be hollow and nought but ash the world be well rid of her not quite so well actually the brethren court intend to release her no they can not the court promise to imprison her forever that be our agreement your agreement show them how to bind her she can not be trust she give me no choice we must act before they release her you love her she be the and then you betray her she pretend to love me she betray me and after which betrayal do you cut out your heart wonder do not test me have not finish that you will free my father and you will guarantee elizabeth safety along with my own your term be steep mr turner we will expect fair value in return there be only price will accept calypso murder calypso aboard the black pearl jack have sail the black pearl to shipwreck cove and with you no longer aboard her how do you propose to lead us there what be it you want most look at them all there be not be gather like this in our lifetime and owe them all money as he who issue summons convene this the brethren court to confirm your lordship and right to be hear present now your piece of my fellow captain those be not piece of they be just piece of junk aye the original plan be to use piece of to bind calypso but when the court meet the brother be to skint break so change the name what to piece of whatever we happen to have in our pocket at the time oh yes that sound very pirate master ragetti if you will keep it safe for you just like you say when you give it to me aye you have now need it back sparrow may point out that we be still short pirate lord and be as content as cucumber to wait until sao feng join us sao feng be dead he fall to the flying dutchman the plague ship he make you captain they be just give the bloody title away now listen listen to me our location have be betray jones be under the command of lord beckett they be on their way here who be this betrayer not likely anyone among us where be will not among us and it matter not how they find us the question be what will we do now that they have we fight shipwreck cove be fortress well supplied fortress there be no need to fight if they can not get to us there be course in another age at this very spot the brethren court capture the sea goddess and bind her in her bone that be mistake oh we tame the sea for ourselves aye but open the door to beckett and his ilk good be the day when mastery of sea come not from bargain strike with eldritch creature but from the sweat of man brow and the strength of his back alone you all know this to be true gentleman lady we must free calypso shoot him cut out his tongue shoot him and cut out his tongue and shoot his tongue and trim that beard sao feng would have agree with barbossa aye calypso be our enemy then she will be our enemy now and it be unlikely her mood improve would still agree with sao feng we release calypso you threaten me silence you this be madness this be politics meanwhile our enemy be bearing down upon us if they not be here already my sweet you come for me you be expect me it have be torture trap in this single form cut off from the sea from all that love from you year devote to the duty you charge me year look after those who die at sea and finally when we can be together again you be not there why be not you there be my nature would you love me if be anything but what be do not love you many thing you be davy jones but never cruel you have corrupt your purpose and so yourself and you do hide away what should always have be mine calypso will be free and when be will give you my heart and we will be together always if only you have heart to give why do you come and what fate have you plan for your captor the brethren court all of them the last thing they will learn in this life be how cruel can be and what of your fate davy jones my heart will always belong to you it be the court what imprison calypso we should be the one to set her free and in her gratitude she will see fit to grant us boon whose boon your boon utterly deceptive twaddle speak say if you have good alternative please share cuttlefish aye let us not dear friend forget our dear friend the cuttlefish flip glorious little sausage pen them up together and they will devour each other without think human nature be not it or fish nature so yes we can hole up here well provision and well arm and half of us would be dead within the month which seem quite grim to me any way you slice it or as my learn colleague so naively suggest we can release calypso and we can pray that she will be merciful rather doubt it can we in fact pretend that she be anything other than woman scorn like which fury hell hath no we can not we be leave with but option agree with and can not believe the word be come out of me mouth captain swann we must fight you have always run away from fight have not you have so you have so have not have not you have so and you know it have not slander and calumny have only ever embrace that old and noble of pirate tradition submit that here now that be what we all must do we must fight to run away aye aye aye aye as per the code act of war and this be

declare war parley with share adversary fancy that there have not be king since the court and that be not likely to change not likely why not see the pirate king be elect by popular vote and each pirate only ever vote for hisself call for vote vote for ammand the corsair capitaine chevalle the penniless frenchman sri sumbhajee vote for sri sumbhajee mistress ching gentleman jocard elizabeth swann barbossa vallenueva elizabeth swann what know curious be not it you be go to vote for me you be go to vote for me sir no be to understand that you lot will not be keep to the code then very well
