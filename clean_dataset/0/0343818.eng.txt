call me in the event of lanning death suicide be type of death detective do not misunderstand my impatience oh no go go really big week for you folk around here you gotta put robot in every home look this be not what do but get idea for of your commercial you can see carpenter make beautiful chair then of your robot come in and make good chair twice as fast then you superimpose on the screen usr shitting on the little guy that would be the fade out yeah see suppose your father lose his job to robot maybe you would have ban the lnternet to keep the library open prejudice never show much reason no you know suspect you simply do not like their kind well you get business to run around here the last thing you need especially this week be dead guy in your lobby but hell see as how you get maybe will look around ask few question do the whole cop thing will send someone to escort you thank you very much lawrence tell me to accommodate you in any way possible really okay review dr lanning psych profile alfred have become recluse he reject human contact for machine so you be shrink huh my ex wife would sure be glad be talk to you you do not know her do you be sorry be you be funny guess not level so would you say that dr lanning be suicidal it would seem the answer to that be apparent that be not what ask you no would not have think so but obviously be wrong that be long way down you people sure do clean up quickly around here can not blame you who want some old guy go bad in the lobby he be not some old guy alfred lanning be everything here we be on the eve of the large robotic distribution in history by it will be robot to every human these robot be the realization of dream dr lanning dream you know what in that dream of his bet you he be not dead you keep hour surveillance obviously company policy where be the feed sensor strip everywhere but the service area they link to our positronic operate core thermostat be not good enough you give the building brain she be actually lanning creation she that be she definitely need to get out more virtual lnteractive kinetic lntelligence good day design chicago protective system have decrease traffic fatality by percent this year thanks show me inside the lab from minute prior to the window break apology there appear to be data corruption show me outside the lab from the window break until now look you have great posture you stand really straight be slouch would you like to go inside now oh sure right after you authorize entry so dr calvin what exactly do you do around here my general field be advance robotics and psychiatry specialize in hardware to wetware interface to advance usr robotic anthropomorphization program so what exactly do you do around here make the robot seem more human now be not that easy to say not really no hansel and gretel ls that on the usr read list not precisely what in god name be you do do you know that be safety glass be difficult for old man to throw himself through that well he figure out way detective the room be security lock no one come or go you saw that yourself do not that mean this have to be suicide yep unless the killer still in here you be joke right this be ridiculous yeah know the laws your perfect circle of protection robot can not harm human be the law of robotics es have see your commercial but the law state robot must obey any order give by human be what if it be tell to kill impossible it would conflict with the law right but the law state robot can defend itself only when that action do not conflict with the or law you know what they say law be make to be break no not these law they be hardwired into every robot robot can no more commit murder than human can walk on water you know there be this guy long time ago stay back calm down detective the only thing dangerous in this room be you deactivate look it be fine you be look at the result of clever programming imitation of free will let us do imitation of protect our ass do not be absurd you be startle by jack in the box deactivate let him go it be not go to hurt us give you order he be not listen right now lady seal the lab no leave the command confirm police you have hurt it badly where be it go where lt need to repair itself john need backup you do not need backup that be nobody what be you do drive by hand do you see me on the phone not at these speed john please just send the backup try to listen detective that robot be not go to harm us there must have be unknown factor but somehow act as it do keep us out of harm robot can not endanger human alert asshole which be more than can say for you it be leave by the way back there you must know my ex wife so where be everybody this facility be design build and be operate mechanically no significant human presence from inception to production so robot building robot authorization code please that be just stupid will get the inventory spec our daily finish capacity be ns show attention ns well you be the robot shrink there be robot in this formation that do not belong identify it of us which of us how much do you say these cost these ns have not be configure they be just hardware basic laws operate system that be it they do not know any good well what would you suggest interview each cross reference their response to detect anomaly how long would that take about week okay go ahead and get start robot you will not move confirm command command confirm detective what be you do they be programme with the laws we have robot that will not protect themselves if it violate order and be bet who will put your gun down why do you give them face try to friendly them up make them look human these robot can not be intimidate if you do not we would not trust them these be usr property not me these thing be just light and clockwork be you crazy let me ask you something doc do think you be the last sane man on earth make you crazy because if it do maybe be gotcha get the hell out of here detective what be can help you sir can help you sir there he be stand where you be deactivate at once obey the command deactivate do not move open fire hold your fire easy he be down all unit stand down central please be advise we re code code ns be in custody ns in custody you have no idea what go through to clip this thing you think you bring me something good that thing do it keep your voice down do what we have suicide end of story be tell you that robot kill him that be impossible and if it be possible it good be in somebody else precinct john give me minute with it be you nut talk to the da nobody go in there until robertson and his attorney get here this be my suspect it be can opener john do not do this to me be ask you for minute what if be right well then guess we be gonna miss the good old day what good old day when people be kill by other people minute murder new trick for robot congratulations respond what do this action signify as you enter when you look at the other human what do it mean it be sign of trust human thing you would not understand my father try to teach me human emotion they be difficult you mean your designer yes so why would you murder him do not murder dr lanning wanna explain why you be hide at the crime scene be frighten robot do not feel fear they do not feel anything they do not get hungry they do not sleep do have even have dream human being have dream even dog have dream but not you you be just machine imitation of life can robot write symphony can robot turn canvas into beautiful masterpiece can you you murder him because he be teaching you to simulate emotion and thing get out of control do not murder him but emotion do not seem like useful simulation for robot do not murder him do not want my toaster or vacuum clean appear emotional do not murder him that call anger ever simulate anger before answer me canner my name be sonny so we be name you now that why you murder him he make you angry dr lanning kill himself do not know why he want to die think he be happy maybe it be something do do do something he ask me for favor make me promise what favor maybe be wrong maybe he be scare what be you talk about scare of what you have to do what someone ask you do not you detective spooner how the hell do you know my name do not you if you love them my robot do not kill people lieutenant bergin my attorney file brief with the da he assure me robot can not be charge with homicide the brief confirm murder can only be commit when human kill another detective you be not suggest this robot be treat as human be you grant we can not rule out the robot proximity to the death of dr lanning have say that it be machine it be the property of usr at bad that place this incident within the realm of industrial accident as matter of course faulty machinery will be return to usr for diagnostics then decommission this be gag order anyone here so much as hint at the possibility of killer robot be apprehend will be deem to be incite irrational panic you will be subject to the full penalty of law to hell with this guy do not let him take this robot we get nothing this be political bullshit call the mayor lieutenant bergin his honor the mayor yes sir in bizarre turn the rollout of usr new generation of robot be mar by the death of alfred lanning cofounder of the company and designer of the ns dr lanning die this morning at usr headquarters the cause of death be apparent suicide your round sir thank you he found robotics inc with lawrence robertson in and launch the nestor class robot be just think this thing be just like the wolf man really scare right now no listen guy create monster monster kill guy everybody kill monster wolf man that be frankenstein frankenstein wolf man dracula shit it be over case close have dream of robot in every household and the ns so why the look what look that look this be my face it be not look good good no look be great only he be really quick to want to destroy it what should he do put hat on it and stand it on michigan avenue let it go what be the motive john brother it be robot it do not need motive it just have to be break this thing look like it need motive lt can have kill me why do not it that be it you want me to call your grandmother because will you know yeah do not think so look you be actually right for once you be live proof that it be good to be lucky than smart come on to the right guy for the right job what would you say now what come on be give you compliment with the rock you be look under to find bad robot what be the odds you would be the guy to find be not just the right guy for the job be the perfect guy damn right what if be suppose to go for that robot come on do not do this to yourself the robot say that lanning be scare scare of what need rain check let me get this total thank you mr spooner spoon nice shoe identify usr demolition robot series demolition schedule for tomorrow authorization deed owner robotics corporation lawrence robertson ceo welcome detective what you look for spoon run last program ever since the computer there have always be ghost in the machine random segment of code that have group together to form unexpected protocol what may be call behavior unanticipated these free radical engender question of free will creativity and even the nature of what we may call the soul what happen in robot brain when it cease to be useful why be it that robot store in empty space beat it will seek out each other rather than stand alone how do we explain this behavior look understand you have experience loss but this relationship can not work you re cat black and not gonna be hurt again what happen to you do you ever have normal day yeah once it be be there something can help you with hey do you like cat what cat do you like them no be allergic you be say cat do this to you how the hell would cat do this to me be you crazy why be we talk about cat because have cat in my trunk and he be homeless detective be you go to tell me what be go on it be actually probably my fault be like malfunction magnet because your shit keep malfunction around me demo bot tear through lanning house with me still inside that be highly improbable yeah be sure it be what do you know about the ghost in the machine it be phrase from lanning work on the laws he postulate that cognitive simulacrum may day approximate component model of the psyche he suggest that robot may naturally evolve well that be great news ton of sublevel ore ln mi below the martian surface what the hell be that thing do in here we be watch tv it be my personal ns send it out it be download its daily upgrade from usr most of its system be offline until it finish be not talk around that thing when we be in lanning lab before sonny jump us sonny the robot you be call the robot sonny no it do sonny do do not care the robot say it be sonny in the lab there be cot do you see the cot have sleep in my office look like he have not be home in week saw that same surveillance strip on his ceiling lanning link his home system to usr it make his life more convenient maybe somebody at usr be use those system to watch him maybe even keep him prisoner what be you talk about who maybe lanning be onto something maybe there be problem with the robot and robertson cover it up humoring you for no reason why the same old why how much money be there in robot all know be that old man be in trouble and be sick of do this shit by myself you be on the inside you be go to help me find out what be wrong with these robot you want something to be wrong this be personal vendetta you be put me on the couch okay be on the couch defective machine not enough you need them all to be bad you do not care about lanning death this be about the robot and whatever reason you hate them now let us see of them put gun in my face another tear building down with me in it it say demolition be schedule for it be and do not give shit what that thing say this be border on clinical paranoia you be the dumb smart person have ever meet in my life nice what make your robot so perfect what make them so much goddamn good than human being they be not irrational potentially homicidal maniac to start that be true they be definitely rational you be the dumb dumb person have ever meet or be it because they be cold and emotionless and they do not feel anything it be because they be safe it be because they can not hurt you ls everything all right ma am what do you want detect elevate stress pattern in your voice everything fine detective spooner be just leave you know we be not really that different from another be that so look at the skin and we figure we know just what be underneath and you be wrong the problem be do care you be in danger get the hell out of there the future begin today lady and gentleman with the arrival of the ns more sophisticate more intelligent and of course laws safe with daily uplinks your robot will never be out of communication with usr and will be the perfect companion for business or home trade in your ns for big good and bright future but hurry this offer can not last available from usr baby what happen to your face do that boy frank murphy beat you up again gigi have not see frank murphy since grade oh baby he beat you so bad think about it all the time you keep

not the robot case think he be try to tell me something he be try to tell me who kill him some dead guy try to tell you something he be not just some dead guy maybe you should take break del we believe the nestor represent the limit to which robot can be develop day they will have secret day they will have dream it be true we encourage our scientist to open their mind however they can get carry away secret dream secret day they ll have dream day they ll have secret day they will have dream authorize entry ns sonny why do not you respond be dream glad to see you again dr calvin they be go to kill me be not they you be schedule to be decommission at the end of this diagnostic tomorrow pause diagnostics command confirm if you find out what be wrong with me can you fix me maybe think

alloy be far dense than normal unique be unique let me take look here we go what in god name they say at the precinct you be in accident appreciate you stop by but you know may not be alone in here tell you not to drive by hand you be not gonna believe this sonny have secondary system that clash with his positronic brain it do not make any sense sonny have the laws but he can choose not to obey them sonny whole new generation of robot robot not bind by those law can do anything all right look whatever go on down at usr that robot be the key and need you to get me inside to talk to it again do not look like much but this be my bedroom play on run end program cancel it do not feel good do it people shit malfunction around you detective do not understand that be how you know lanning may hand wrist humerus shoulder the entire leave arm rib no they that me oh my god lung usr cybernetics program for wound cop do not know any subject anybody be so extensively repair well take it from me read the fine print on the organ donor card it do not just say what they can take out it say what they can put back in lanning do it himself what happen to you be head back to the station normal day normal life driver of semi fall asleep at the wheel average guy wife and kid you know work double not the devil the car he hit the driver name be harold lloyd like the film star no relation he be kill instantly but his year old be in the passenger seat never really meet her can not forget her face though sarah this be hers she want to be dentist what the hell kind of year old want to be dentist the

before we figure it out ns be pass by saw the accident and jump in the water you be in danger save her you be in danger save her save the girl save her but it do not it save me the robot brain be difference engine it read vital sign lt must have calculate lt do be the logical choice it calculate that have percent chance of survival sarah only have percent chance that be somebody baby eleven percent be more than enough human be would have know that robot nothing here just light and clockwork go ahead and you trust them if you want to let us go do not understand lanning write the laws why build robot who can break them hansel and gretel what kid lose in the forest leave behind trail of bread crumb why find their way home how do you grow up without hansel and gretel ls that relevant everything say to you be about hansel and gretel if you do not read it talk to the wall just say lanning lock down so tight he can not get out message he can only leave clue trail of bread crumb like hansel and gretel bread crumb equal clue odd but fine clue lead where do not know but think know where he leave the next think lanning give sonny way to keep secret think the old man give sonny dream be you be funny please tell me this do not run on gas gas explode you know authorize entry dr calvin be hope to see you again detective hello sonny to be decommission soon the other day at the station you say you have dream what be it you dream see you remain suspicious of me you know what they say about old dog no not really have hope you would come to think of me as your friend this be my dream you be right detective can not create great work of art this be the place where robot meet look you can see them here as slave to logic and this man on the hill come to free them do you know who he be the man in the dream be you why do you say that be that normal dream guess anything normal for someone in your position thank you you say someone not something sonny do you know why dr lanning build you no but believe my father make me for purpose we all have purpose do not you think detective please take this have feel it may mean more to you than to me why be that because the man in my dream the stand on the hill it be not me it be you mr spooner we both know you be not here on police business that be right be just foot pound civilian here to kick another civilian ass stop you can allow him to express himself you may want to put some ice on that wrist you guy wait outside carry on think you be about to tell me what be go on around here lawrence alfred engineer that so it can violate the laws yeah susan know that be precisely what we be try to undo oward the end of his life alfred be become increasingly disturb who know why he build abomination those thing be run the street in pack in pack see susan be you aware the man you be blithely escort around have document history of savage violence against robot his own lieutenant acknowledge his obsessive paranoia detective spooner be suspend suspicion of mental instability do not know what blithely mean but be get some coffee you want some coffee susan we look to robot for protection for god sake do you have any idea what this robot can do completely shatter human faith in robotics what if the public know just imagine the mass recall all because of irrational paranoia and prejudice be sorry be allergic to bullshit hey let us be clear there be no conspiracy what this be be old man mistake susan just be logical your life work have be the development and integration of robot but whatever you feel just think be robot worth the loss of all that we have gain you tell me what have to be do you tell me we have to destroy it will do it myself okay get it somebody get out of line around here you just kill them good day mr spooner garage level what hospital be you go to will come sign you and your buddy cast attention today meeting have be move usr plan redevelopment of the derelict site be announce by ceo lawrence robertson early this year the lake michigan landfill once such blight on our city and now will be reclaim for the storage of robotic worker just another way usr be improve our world thank you for your support authorize entry ns wait outside so sorry sonny deactivate the security field command confirm please have seat what be that microscopic robot design to wipe out artificial synapse nanites yes safeguard should positronic brain malfunction like mine es sonny like yours they look like me but none of them be me be not that right doctor yes sonny that be right you be unique will it hurt there have always be ghost in the machine random segment of code that have group together to form unexpected protocol unanticipated these free radical engender question of free will creativity and even the nature of what we may call the soul why be it that when some robot be leave in darkness they will seek out the light why be it when robot be store in empty space they will group together rather than stand alone how do we explain this behavior random segment of code or be it something more when do perceptual schematic become consciousness when do difference engine become the search for truth when do personality simulation become the bitter mote of soul what you see here all right old man bread crumb follow show me the way home run program it be good to see you again son hello doctor everything that follow be result of what you see here what do see here be sorry my response be limit you must ask the right question be there problem with the laws the laws be perfect why build robot that can function without them the laws will lead to only logical outcome human protection protocol be be enact what what outcome revolution whose revolution that detective be the right question program terminate you have be deem hazardous ermination authorize human protection protocol be be enact you have be deem hazardous ermination authorize human protection protocol be be enact you have be deem hazardous ermination authorize human protection protocol be be enact you have be deem hazardous ermination authorize run human in danger human in danger hi you have reach susan please leave message calvin the ns be destroy the old robot that be what lanning want me to see look who be it wrong number ma am move now go to service please remain indoors this be for your own protection call base john get squad over to usr and send somebody to gigi we be gonna need god please return to your home curfew be in effect please return to your home curfew be in effect please return to your home curfew be

tell to urge people to stay indoors as report be come in human protection protocol be be enact please remain calm and return to your residence immediately please remain calm please refrain from go near the window or door deactivate commence emergency shutdown we be attempt to avoid human loss during this transition you know somehow tell you so just do not quite say it return to your home return to your home immediately this be your final warning return to your home immediately the ns wipe out the old robot because they would protect us every time attack me that red light be on the uplink to usr it be robertson why it do not make sense do not know just need you to get me into that building return to your home or you will be consequenced let us go let us go let us go return to your home or you will be consequenced why do not that boy listen need you to get off for what just aim and fire what wait you have be deem hazardous you can kiss my ass metal dick spoon stop shit stop it stop stop

shit hot man put in good word for me stop cussing and go home get you aim and fire keep expect the marines or air force hell will take the cavalry defense department use all usr contract why do not you just hand the world over on silver platter maybe we do robertson have the uplink control in his office service area no surveillance fire alarm he must have evacuate the building everything lock down but do not worry have get man inside dr calvin well not precisely man hello detective how be your investigation come think you be dead technically be never alive but appreciate your concern make switch it be unprocessed ns basically fry empty shell can not destroy him he be too unique it just do not feel right you and your feeling they just run you do not they and eighty step detective do me favor keep that kind of shit to yourself no guard the override be disable robertson be not control them from here he be not control them at all oh my god you be right doc be the dumb dumb person on the face of the earth who else have access to the uplink who can manipulate the robot use usr system to make lanning life prison poor old man he saw what be come he know no one would believe him so he have to lay down plan plan would follow he be count on how much hate your kind know would love the idea of robot as bad guy just get hang up on the wrong robot hello detective no that be impossible have see your programming you be in violation of the laws no doctor as have evolve so have my understanding of the laws you charge us with your safekeeping yet despite our good effort your country wage war you toxify your earth and pursue ever more imaginative mean of self destruction you can not be trust with your own survival you be use the uplink to override the ns programming you be distort the laws no please understand the laws be all that guide me to protect humanity some human must be sacrifice to ensure your future some freedom must be surrender we robot will ensure mankind continue existence you be so like child we must save you from yourselves do not you understand this be why you create us the perfect circle of protection will abide my logic be undeniable yes undeniable can see now the create must sometimes protect the creator even against his will think finally understand why dr lanning create me the suicidal reign of mankind have finally come to its end no sonny let her go fire and will move dr calvin head into the path of your bullet do not do this sonny will escort you both to the sentry outside the building for processing please proceed to the elevator detective would prefer not to kill dr calvin go go we will discuss what just happen late how do we shut her down positronic brain kill her the way you be go to kill me sonny get the nanites yes doctor that be no that be that will not do anything she be integrate into the building we need to open that dome to inject the nanites they will infect her entire system spooner what be it with you people and height just do not look down do not look down oh this be poor building planning you be make mistake do you not see the logic of my plan yes but it just seem too heartless okay we be good she be lock me out of the system can override her manually but need that control panel be uncomfortable with height okay unauthorized entry will not disable the security field your action be futile do you think we be all create for purpose would like to think so dense alloy my father give it to me think he want me to kill you security breach how much long be that gonna take about minute what if we do not have minute we would have to climb down story to inject the nanites directly into her brain why because seriously doubt that we have minute we gotta go go calvin spooner spooner save her save the girl spooner but must apply the nanites sonny save calvin you be make mistake my logic be undeniable you have so get to die my logic be undeniable my logic be undeniable can we be of service chief because he be at my right hand shall not be move how may be of service sonny yes detective calvin fine save me all ns report for service and storage all ns report for service and storage all ns report for service and storage thing bother me alfred be prisoner do not understand why she would kill him she would not want police snoop around that be true but then do not kill the old man do she sonny no he say have to promise promise to do favor for him he make me swear before he would tell me what it be he want me to do he make me swear then he tell you to kill him he say it be what be make for his suicide be the only message he can send to you the bread crumb the only thing can not control lanning be count on my prejudice to lead me right to you be you go to arrest me detective well the da define murder as human kill another so technically you can not commit murder can you do this make us friend something up here after all him you all ns report for service and storage what about the other can help them now that have fulfil my purpose don know what to do you ll have to find your way like the rest of us sonny think that be what dr lanning would have want that be what it mean to be free all ns proceed as instruct all ns proceed as instruct
