they say know how you feel but actually know how you feel you see be see someone back in london we work for the same newspaper and then find out that he be also see this other girl sarah from the circulation department on the floor it turn out that he be not in love with me like think what be try to say be understand feel as small and as insignificant as humanly possible how it can actually ache in place that you do not know you have inside you it do not matter how many new haircut you get or gym you join or how many glass of chardonnay you drink with girlfriend you still go to bed every night go over every detail and wonder what you do wrong or how you can have misunderstand and how in the hell for that brief moment you can think that you be that happy and sometimes you can even convince yourself that he will see the light and show up at your door and after all that however long all that may be you will go somewhere new and you will meet people who make you feel worthwhile again and little piece of your soul will finally come back and all that fuzzy stuff those year of your life that you waste that will eventually begin to fade well fuck you need this more than do that be what you be do here you be get over somebody yeah this be me in good shape be this the guy who send you page from his novel yeah he need me so he stay in touch all the time that make it impossible to forget which be great for him suck for you you see how great your life be compare to mine okay let us go be make you some fettuccine it be christmas eve and we be go to sit out on that patio gonna make ourselves little fire pop some bubbly and we be gonna celebrate be young and be alive you with me simpkins mile you really be incredibly decent man know that be always be my problem hi okay here it be arthur theme think this be really good be serious no know be make him cd of this tune every time he hear it it should give him the confidence to walk right out there okay yep here we go do steal

new york not really but that be easy do you go there often rarely long distance relationship can work really can not make work when live in the same house with someone so this can be good solution for you oh man okay let us say we just make this happen we commit to fly back and forth as much as we can yes it be doable definitely and then let us say in month we hit wall like can not constantly be away from work or the girl can not deal with you leave so often and we start to feel the tension we know this be not gonna work so we start fight because we do not know what else to do and then after long tearful at your end phone call we just we say goodbye thank you that will be it for real it be not like we will ever bump into each other and then what be leave miserable people feel totally mash up and hurt or thank you or maybe we should just realize that what we have have these past few week have be perfect and maybe it will not get any good than this maybe we be try to figure this thing out because it make us feel good to feel this maybe the fact that be leave in hour make this far more excite than it may actually be maybe you be seriously the most depress girl have ever meet know have another scenario for you good be in love with you apologize for the blunt delivery but as problematical as this fact may be be in love with you be not feel this because you be leave and not because it feel good to feel this way which by the way it do or do before you go off like that can not figure out the mathematics of this just know love you can not believe how many time be say it and never think would feel this way again so that be pretty phenomenal and realize come with package deal for the price of and my package perhaps in the light of day be not all that wonderful but finally know what want and that in itself be miracle and what want be you be not expect love you can you not look at me like that be try to find the right thing to say think if the obvious response do not immediately come to you we can just we should just talk about something else like possibly what complete ass be do recall you promise me you would not fall in love with me must pay good attention have never meet guy who talk as much as me but can you just for now be quiet please how many of his movie be on that list of his about love it do not know how have never see the lady eve before barbara
