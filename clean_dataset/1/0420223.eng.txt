lake in eastern poland pollution from nearby factory be slowly kill the small fish and insect on which these creature feed all attempt to move the bird to similar body of water have fail perhaps it be the familiarity alone that keep them here or perhaps it be unwillingness to lose the collective memory of the once beautiful hill that surround the lake and it take only second for the fiddler crab to realize that the wader they may once have fear have now become their prey the wound bird know its fate its desperate attempt to escape only underscore the hopelessness of its plight the primate sad

so much much have change for harold over the past few week his attitude towards work his habitual count his love life but of all the transmutation harold crick have undergo perhaps the most significant be that today on his return to work he be not late for the kronecker bus what harold have not understand about that week prior be that the time he receive from his fellow commuter be in fact full minute late than the actual time and therefore full minute late than the time to which his watch and life have be previously set not the bad of error but if harold have not set his watch to the incorrect time harold would have again barely catch the kronecker bus and he would not be approach the bus stop precisely at this particular excuse me harold otherwise ignorable fact until the unthinkable occur oh my god oh my god need for everyone to just stay seat come on son what happen do not see him it be not your fault he be try to help the boy get your supervisor do not believe this

have choice have to it be it be okay it be not great no it be okay it be not bad it be not the most amaze piece of english literature in several year but it be okay you know think be fine with okay it do not make sense with the rest of the book though no not yet will rewrite the rest my assistant say she would go back to the publisher and request more time why do not know it be awfully sweet though no why do you change the book lot of reason realize just can not do it because he be real because it be book about man who do not know he be about to die and then die but if the man do know he be go to die and die anyway die willingly know he can stop it then mean be not that the type of man you want to keep alive as harold take bite of bavarian sugar cookie he finally feel as if everything be go to be okay sometimes when we lose ourselves in fear and despair in routine and constancy in hopelessness and tragedy we can thank god for bavarian sugar cookie and fortunately when there be not any cookie we can still find reassurance in familiar hand on our skin or kind and love gesture or subtle encouragement or love embrace or offer of comfort not to mention hospital gurney and nose plug and uneaten danish and soft spoken secret and fender stratocasters and maybe the occasional piece of fiction and we must remember that all these thing the nuance the anomaly the subtlety which we assume only accessorize our day be in fact here for much large and noble cause they be here to save our life know the idea seem strange but also know that it just so happen to be true and so it be wristwatch save harold crick
