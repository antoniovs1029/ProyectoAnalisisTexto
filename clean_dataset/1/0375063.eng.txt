brother well it be uh it be difficult to summarize um it start out as kind of first person narrative about guy take care of his father after stroke it be kind of base on uh personal experience but only only loosely what be the title the day after yesterday oh you mean today um uh yeah mean right but it be more so it be about like death and mortality or uh yeah not really uh it de it jump around lot that be what it be about in way you know what mean you start to see everything from the point of view of the father and uh lot of other thing happen parallel narrative it be kind of mess and then eventually the whole thing sort of evolve or devolve into this sort of robbe grillet mystery you know but no real resolution wow it well think it be really great you be get it publish really mean know how hard it be just to write it even yeah mean like me have get this paper due on and be freak out about it just like in high school paper huh yeah be go for master degree in horticulture sorta chip away on it horticulture really mmm do not even know that there be college here well commute to san luis obispo twice week horticulture wow so do you want to work in winery or something maybe oh hmm so when can read your book well you know well do happen to have manuscript in my car um it be not proof or anything so it be it be full of typo if you do not mind typo oh no who care be the queen of typo okay mmm ahh you know can ask you personal question miles sure why be you so into pinot mean it be like thing with you uh do not know do not know um it be hard grape to grow as you know right it be uh it be thin skinned temperamental ripen early it be you know it be not survivor like cabernet which can just grow anywhere and thrive even when it be neglect no pinot need constant care and attention you know and in fact it can only grow in these really specific little tucked away corner of the world and and only the most patient and nurture of grower can do it really only somebody who really take the time to understand pinot potential can then coax it into its full expression and then mean oh its flavour they be just the most haunt and brilliant and thrill and subtle and ancient on the planet no mean you know cabernet can be powerful and exalt too but they seem prosaic to me for some reason by comparison do not know do not know what about you what about me do not know why be you into wine oh think originally get into wine through my ex husband you know he have this big sort of show off cellar you know right but then discover that have really sharp palate and the more drink the more like what it make me think about like what like what fraud he be wow no mean like to think about the life of wine yeah how it be live thing like to think about what be go on the year the grape be grow how the sun be shine if it rain like to think about all the people who tend and pick the grape and if it be old wine how many of them must be dead by now like how wine continue to evolve like if open bottle of wine today it would taste different than if would open it on any other day because bottle of wine be actually alive and it be constantly evolve and gain complexity that be until it peak like your and then it begin its steady inevitable decline hmm and it taste so fucking good yeah but you know uh like other wine besides pinot too mean lately have be really into rieslings you like rieslings rieslings mm hmm there be bathroom in the back yeah it be through the kitchen will be right back god you be such fuckin loser you make me so fuckin sick oh god ah come on hi be just get some
