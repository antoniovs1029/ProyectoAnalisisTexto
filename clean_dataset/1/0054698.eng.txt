from here to that door will give you hi have come up to talk to you about the other night then saw the paper and well actually be kind of embarrass about it but since it concern you think ought to talk to you about it in person what the earplug can not go through the whole thing again it be sufficient to say have come to make up and as add inducement have all kind of news can come in guess so just minute do have nightgown on no do not would you mind turn around for oh never mind it be such corny line anyway will turn around myself come in have you see the paper rusty you mean yes know all about it certainly have him peg wrong do not think he be just rat but he be super rat all along super rat in rat clothing you do not even know the good part not only be he rat or super rat rather he be also break break mean but not farthing his family have money of course but he personally be break it turn out he owe can you imagine anyone owe yes anyway that be why he decide to marry the queen of the pig people will tell you thing fred darling would marry you for your money in minute would you marry me for my money in minute so guess it be pretty lucky neither of us be rich yeah fred darling be so glad to see you what have you be do write mostly sell story just get word this morning oh that be marvellous it really be but only how do your decorator friend feel about it think you be suppose to be save yourself and all of that you know something have not get around to tell her about it yet look why do not we go out and have drink or take walk or something to celebrate all right think there be some champagne in the icebox why do not you open it while get dress okay do not think have ever drink champagne before breakfast before with breakfast on several occasion but never before before now have get wonderful idea we can spend whole day do thing we have never do before we will take turn something you have never do then me of course can not really think of anything have never do have never be for walk in the morning before at least not since have be in new york have walk up fifth avenue at but as far as be concern that be still night do you think it count sure it count now we be even do not you just love it love what tiffany be not it wonderful you see what mean how nothing bad can ever happen to you in place like this it be not that give hoot about jewelery except diamond of course like that what do you think well of course personally think it would be tacky to wear diamond before be well you be right but in the meantime you should have something will wait no be gonna buy you present you buy me typewriter ribbon and it bring me luck all right but tiffany can be pretty expensive have get my cheque and oh would not let you cash your cheque but present for or under that will accept of course do not exactly know what we be go to find at tiffany for may help you perhaps actually we be look for present for the lady certainly sir be there something special you have in mind well we have consider diamond now do not want to offend you but the lady feel that diamond be tacky for her oh think they be divine on old woman but do not think they would be right for me you do understand certainly in all fairness think ought to explain there be also secondary problem of finance we can only afford to spend limit amount may ask how limit that be the outside figure yes see do you have anything for well frankly madam within that price range the variety of merchandise be rather limit however do think we may have let me see strictly as novelty you understand for the lady and gentleman who have everything sterling silver telephone dialer at include tax sterling silver telephone dialer yes sir at include federal tax well the price be right but must say would rather hope for something slightly more how shall say it romantic in feel what do you think as sterling silver telephone dialers go certainly think it be handsome but well you do understand well we try but guess we can have something engrave can not we yes suppose so yes indeed the only problem be you would more or less have to buy something if only in order to have some object upon which to place the engraving you see the difficulty well we can have this engrave can not we think it would be very smart this take it be not purchase at tiffany no actually it be purchase concurrent with well actually it come inside of well box of cracker jack see do they still really have prize in cracker jack box oh yes that be nice to know it give feel of solidarity almost of continuity with the past that sort of thing do you think tiffany would really engrave it for us mean you do not think they would feel it be beneath them or anything like that well it be rather unusual madam but think you will find that tiffany be very understanding if you would tell me what initial you would like think we can have something ready for you in the morning do not tell you this be lovely place what be this place anyway you say you want to sit down it be the public library you have never be here no that make for me do not see any book they be in there see each of these little drawer be stuff with little card and each little card be book or author think that be fascinate really look be not it marvellous there you be right in the public library varjak paul lives and then lot of number do you think they really have the book itself live sure follow me number that be us fifty seven please lives by varjak paul do you ever read it it be absolutely marvellous no be afraid have
